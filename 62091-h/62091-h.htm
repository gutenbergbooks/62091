<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> compiler of these pages does not labour under the delusion that he
has written a book. All that he has attempted has been, as it were,
to invite his reader to an arm-chair in his study, and to place in the
reader’s hands a succession of open volumes and copies of manuscripts
containing passages which throw more or less light upon the lives of
the first Duke and Duchess of Newcastle. Occasionally he has ventured
to make a few remarks, either of introduction or of retrospection,
concerning the evidence thus brought before his guest, remarks which
may easily be skipped at will.</p>

<p>This humble form of literary labour has the signal advantage that, if
it fails to attract the reader, it succeeds in affording an object for
reading to the writer.</p>

<p>Much assistance has been most kindly given in this work by Mr. Walter
Herries Pollock.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> one or two former works relating to the seventeenth century, it has
been the writer’s misfortune to lead his readers over rather muddy
roads into somewhat shady places; but it will now be his privilege
to offer himself as their guide along smooth paths paved with the
strictest propriety into regions “of sweetness and delight,” where they
may bask in the sunshine of unmitigated respectability. There will be
nothing in these pages to give offence (and therefore pleasure) to Mrs.
Grundy, or to raise that tender blush on the cheek of a maiden, which
he has been assured still exists; although he has never yet had the
good fortune to see it.</p>

<p>The two chief sources of information about the earlier
part of the lives of the first Duke and Duchess of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, are <cite>The History of the Rebellion</cite>,
by Lord Clarendon; and <cite>The Life of the
Most Illustrious Prince, William Duke of Newcastle</cite>,
by Margaret Duchess of Newcastle. The first-mentioned
book needs no recommendation; as to
the second and its fellow-works, such high authorities
as the Master and other Dons of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College,
Cambridge, wrote to its author: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>“Your Excellencies
books ... will not only survive our University, but
hold date even with time itself; ... and incontinently
this age, by reading of your books, will lose its
barbarity and rudeness, being made tame by the
elegance of your style and matter”.</p>

<p>In case this testimony should not be considered
sufficient, another contemporary criticism shall be
produced, namely, that of a certain Mr. Pepys, who
kept a diary, and wrote in it on the 18th of March,
1667 (the same year in which the Master and Dons
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s wrote their letter quoted above)&mdash;“Staid
at home reading the ridiculous History of my Lord
Newcastle, wrote by his wife; which shows her to
be a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman, and he an
asse to suffer her to write what she writes to him and
of him”. Probably an estimate of the Duchess’s book,
about half-way between that of the Dons and that
of the diarist, would not be very far from a just one.</p>

<p>A serious drawback to most biographies is that they
begin with the dull subject of family history and end
with the dreary one of death; and, of the two, the
latter frequently affords less dreary reading than the
former. Happily, in the present instance, pedigree
can be almost dispensed with; for it would be an insult
to the reader to suppose him ignorant of the history
of so celebrated a family as that of Cavendish,
which, as Burke observes, “laid the foundations of its
greatness originally on the share of Abbey lands, obtained,
at the dissolution of the monasteries, by Sir
William Cavendish”. This Sir William Cavendish
left two sons who had issue; the eldest of these,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>William, became first Earl of Devonshire, and the
younger, Sir Charles of Welbeck Abbey, was the
father of William Cavendish (the chief subject of
these pages), who became first Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

<p>Those who profess to understand the mysteries of
heredity say that children more frequently inherit
the characteristics of their grandparents than those of
their parents, and that a great man more often had a
brilliant mother or grandmother than a brilliant father
or grandfather. The William Cavendish in whom it
is hoped that the reader may be interested had a very
remarkable grandmother in Margaret, the third wife
of Sir William Cavendish of the aforesaid Abbey
Lands. She was a widow when Sir William married
her, and she had inherited her late husband’s large
estates under settlements. This estimable woman
had no less than four rich husbands and succeeded
in obtaining magnificent settlements from every one
of them.</p>

<p>Collins<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> says that, on the death of Sir William
Cavendish, she married Sir William <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lowe, “possessor
of divers fair lordships in Gloucester, which, in
articles of marriage, she took care should be settled
on her, and her own heirs, in default of issue by him,
and accordingly, having no child by him, she lived to
enjoy his whole estate, excluding his former daughters
and brothers.” On his death she married George,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Earl of Shrewsbury, “whom she brought to terms”
in an excellent marriage settlement, and she made
him marry his eldest son and heir to her own
youngest daughter, and his youngest daughter to
her own eldest son. Well, in her case, may Collins
speak of “Conditions that, perhaps, never fell to
any one woman ... to rise by every husband into
greater wealth, and higher honours; to have an
unanimous issue by one husband only, etc.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <cite>Historical Collections of the Noble Families of Cavendish, etc.</cite>,
p. 14 <abbr title="sequel"><i>seq.</i></abbr></p></div>

<p>The “unanimous issue by one husband only” was
the best part of the business, as it had the effect of
concentrating the riches of four very wealthy husbands
upon the offspring of one.</p>

<p>The grandmother of the first Duke of Newcastle,
says Collins, “built three of the most elegant seats
that were ever raised by one hand within the same
county, beyond example, Chatsworth, Hardwick,
and Oldcoates, all transmitted to the first Duke of
Devonshire”.</p>

<p>Collins presently hints at a slight thorn which accompanied
the roses of Lady Shrewsbury’s riches, at
a certain period. He says: “It must not be forgotten,
that this lady had the honour to be the Keeper of
Mary, Queen of Scots, committed prisoner to George,
Earl of Shrewsbury for seventeen years.” On the
tomb of her husband, George, at Sheffield, is inscribed:
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod licet a malevolis propter suspectam cum captiva
Regina familiaritatem saepius male audivit</i>”.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">THE CASTLE OF THE OGLES</p>
<p class="captioncenter">Inherited by Newcastle from his mother. From his book on horsemanship</p>
</div>

<p>Possibly the excellent Lady Shrewsbury may have
been more concerned about her husbands making first-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>rate
settlements upon her before marriage, than about
their morals after marriage. In the case of Mary,
Queen of Scots, however, she gave Queen Elizabeth
a gentle hint that there were “goings-on,” with the
result that Lord Shrewsbury was immediately deprived
of the smiles of his captive Queen.</p>

<p>The Sir William Cavendish with whom we have to
deal was born during the reign of Queen Elizabeth in
1592. Of course his mother was an heiress. Undoubtedly
his grandmother would not have allowed
his father to marry any one who was not! She was,
in fact, the younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses
of the seventh Baron Ogle. The elder
co-heiress was the wife of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and,
as was very proper, she died without issue.</p>

<p>Collins<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has a little to tell us about Cavendish’s
boyhood.</p>

<p>“After his school-learning, he was entered a scholar of <abbr
title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College, in Cambridge; but, delighting
more in sports than in books, his father finding he had a ready wit,
and a very good disposition, suffered him to follow his own genius, and
had him instructed, by the best masters, in the arts of horsemanship
and weapons, which he was most inclined to, and soon became master of
them.”</p>

<p>As the Duchess of Newcastle is said to have consulted her
husband about her writings, and as he is reported to have helped
her considerably in writing them, it is highly probable that
her account of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"
id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>education of a boy of the period describes
Newcastle’s own experiences. In her <cite>Nature’s Pictures by Fancy’s
Pencil</cite>, she says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>“His education, in the first place, was
to learn the horn-book, from that his primer, and so the Bible, by
his mother’s chambermaid or the like. But after he came to ten years
old or thereabouts he went to a free school where the noise of each
scholar’s reading aloud did drown the sense of what they read, burying
the knowledge and understanding in the confusion of many words, and
several languages; yet was whipt for not learning by their tutors,
for their ill-teaching them, which broke and weakened their memories
with the over-heavy burthens, striving to thrust in more learning than
could be digested or kept in the brain.... After some time he was sent
to the University, there continuing from the age of fourteen to the
years of eighteen; at last considering with himself that he was buried
to the world and the delights therein, conversing more with the dead
than the living, in reading old authors, and that little company he
had, was only at prayers, and meat; wherein the time of the one was
taken up in devotion, the other in eating, or rather fasting; for
their prayers were so long and their commons so short, that it seemed
rather an humiliation and fasting, than an eating and thanksgiving.
But their conversation was a greater penance than their spare diet;
for their disputations, which are fed by contradictions, did more
wrack the brain, than the other did gripe the belly, the one filling
the head with vain opinions and false imaginations, for want of the
light of truth, as the other with wind and rude humours, for want of
a sufficient nourishment. Where upon these considerations he left the
University.”</p>

<p>Could there be a greater contrast than that between Oxford or
Cambridge life in the seventeenth century and in the twentieth?</p>

<p>Despite what Collins says about the young Cavendish delighting
more in sports than in books, as well as a statement by his Duchess
that “to school-learning he never showed a great inclination,” it is
said in the <cite>Biographia Britannica</cite><a name="FNanchor_4_4"
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
that his father, “discovering, even in his infancy, the strongest
marks of an extraordinary genius, etc...., was extremely careful in
the cultivation of them, and took all imaginable pains to have him
instructed, as well in sciences as in languages; so that, at an age
when most young gentlemen are but entering on knowledge, he might be
truly said to have acquired a large stock of solid learning, which
was adorned with an easy and polite behaviour, that, except on proper
occasions, entirely concealed the scholar under the more taking
appearance of the fine gentleman.”</p>

<p>Thomas Hobbes, the “Philosopher of Malmsbury,” was tutor to
William’s first cousin, whose name was also William. Hobbes may or
may not have acted as tutor to the subject of our story; but it was
probably through Hobbes’s introduction in a tutorial capacity into the
Cavendish family that he became an intimate friend of the William with
whom we are concerned.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p> <p>Cavendish was taken early to the
Court of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> who made him a Knight
of the Bath when he was about 17 or 18, and he was sent from thence to
Savoy, with the Ambassador Extraordinary, Sir Henry Wotton. It was thus
Cavendish’s fortune to be thrown early in life into the company of a
man of considerable culture and no little experience of foreign Courts.
Wotton had had an opportunity of earning the deep gratitude of James
<abbr title="the first">I</abbr> in a rather romantic episode; but
when that King sent him as his Ambassador to Venice, he was asked (at
Augsburg) to contribute to a lady’s album, and he was so imprudent as
to write: “An Ambassador is an honest man, sent abroad to lie for the
good of his country.” King James was told of this and was so offended
that, for five years after Wotton’s return from Venice, he gave him no
further employment. Then he relented, and, at the time with which we
are now dealing, James sent him as his representative to the Duke of
Savoy, who, after having been allied with Spain against France, was now
making an alliance with France against Spain.</p>

<p>In Wotton, who eventually became Provost of Eton, Cavendish had as a
companion a man of letters. Of his poetry only two fragments shall be
quoted.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    </div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Untrue she was: yet I believed her eyes</div>
      <div class="indent12">(Instructed spies)</div>
      <div class="verse">Till I was taught that love was but a school</div>
      <div class="indent12">To breed a fool.</div>
    </div>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&mdash;love, lodged in a woman’s breast,</div>
      <div class="indent12">Is but a guest.</div>
    </div></div></div>

 <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"
 id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p> <p>Wotton’s literary tastes may have
 had the effect of implanting a love of literature in Cavendish, or at
 least of inducing him to dabble in literature. The very fact of his
 father’s never pressing the boy to give much attention to books or
 scholars in early youth, may have disposed him to cultivate both at
 maturity.</p>

 <p>It was an advantage for Cavendish to learn something of foreign
 countries and customs at the Court of the Duke of Savoy; and
 in courtiery,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as in other professions,
 it is well for a man to make the inevitable mistakes of early practice
 away from home. At that Court he was treated with great kindness. The
 Duchess of Newcastle writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“He went to travel with <em>Sir Henry Wotton</em> who was sent as
Ambassador Extraordinary to the then <em>Duke of Savoy</em>; which
Duke made very much of My Lord, and when he would be free in Feasting,
placed Him next to himself. Before My Lord did return with the
Ambassador into <em>England</em>, the said Duke profer’d my Lord, that
if he would stay with him, he would not onely confer upon him the best
Titles of Honour he could, but also give him an honourable Command in
War, although My Lord was but young, for the Duke had then some designs
of War. But the Ambassador, who had taken the care of My Lord, would
not leave Him behind without His Parents consent.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> A word used by Ben Jonson.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“At last, when My Lord took his leave of the Duke, the Duke being a
very generous person, presented him with a <em>Spanish</em> Horse, a
saddle very richly embroidered, and with a rich Jewel of Diamonds.”</p>

<p>About a year after William Cavendish’s return from Savoy, his
father died; but the dates of the events recently recorded in this
chapter vary so much according to different authorities, that it is
difficult to arrive at anything like accuracy respecting them. Sir
Charles Cavendish left his son great wealth and, as a very rich man
was a valuable asset even to a King in those early times, Cavendish’s
position at Court became more than doubly assured. On the other hand,
he is said not to have been a favourite of that almighty potentate,
Buckingham, although their correspondence shows that they professed to
be on terms of friendship.</p>

<p>Some five years after his father’s death, Cavendish married. His
second wife thus describes the marriage with his first:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His mother, being then a Widow, was desirous that My Lord should
marry; in obedience to whose commands, he chose a Wife both to his own
good liking, and his Mothers approving; who was Daughter and Heir to
William Basset of Blore<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a
href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Esq., a very honourable
and ancient family in <em>Staffordshire</em>, by whom was added a great
part to His Estate, as hereafter shall be mentioned”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This was the Blore near Ashbourne, and not the Blore near

was fought.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>Elsewhere the Duchess is condescending enough to say that “his first
wife was a very kind, loving and Virtuous Lady,” which, in most cases,
might be taken to mean about the worst that one lady could politely say
of another.</p>

<p>Collins states that Cavendish’s first wife, who, by the way, was the
widow of the first Earl of Suffolk, “brought him a yearly inheritance
of £2400, besides a jointure for life of £800 <abbr title="per
annum"><i>per ann.</i></abbr> and between six and seven thousand pounds
in money”. Something over £3000 a year in those days would be the
equivalent of more than £10,000 in ours, and Cavendish seems to have
inherited some of his celebrated grandmother’s talent for falling in
love upon a sound financial basis. His Duchess writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“After My Lord was married, he lived, for the most part, in the
country, and pleased Himself and his neighbours with Hospitality, and
such delights as the Country afforded; onely now and then he would go
up to <em>London</em> for some short time to wait on the King”.</p>

<p>Possibly the frowns of Buckingham may have perceptibly increased
Cavendish’s appreciation of “such delights as the Country afforded”.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1620, Cavendish was raised to the peerage.
The Duchess says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“About this time King <em>James</em> of blessed memory, having
a purpose to confer some Honour upon My Lord, made him Viscount
<em>Mansfield</em>, and Baron of <em>Bolsover</em>”.</p>

<p>But the event is less prettily described in a State

<p>From this it seems that the Duchess would have
been nearer the mark if she had writen:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“About this time King James, of blessed memory, having a purpose
to smooth over a troublesome dispute, made my Lord Viscount Mansfield

<p>There is reason for suggesting the last clause. From what the
Duchess wrote, it might be inferred that these honours were given
simply as the reward of merit, without any monetary payment on the part
of the recipient; but judging from the following very matter-of-fact
letter from Cavendish, about a peerage, not for himself but for
another, a somewhat different inference might excusably be drawn.</p>

<p>Cavendish, even early in his life, lent, or gave, large sums to
the King, and by what he says about “quittinge of an olde debt,” he
probably means that his peerages were given to him in lieu of payment
of the debts owed to him by the King. He continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>It may have been observed that Cavendish writes as if payment for
peerages were a matter of course, a rule in fact; and, allowing for the
difference in the value of money, they appear to have cost as much then
as they cost now, or even more. Evidently any man “willing to receave
honor,” and willing to pay for it, was looked upon as fair game.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century there was no central Conservative or
central Liberal fund to receive the payments for peerages. Who then
received them? Would it be the King? or would it be Buckingham?</p>

<p>“My cosen Pierepoint” must have submitted to be bled and to be
bled freely; for a couple of months later he was created Baron
Pierrepont, of Holme Pierrepont, Co. Nottingham, and Viscount Newark;
and a year later he was created Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull.<a
name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Probably Buckingham took Cavendish’s advice
as to Pierrepont, “spoke with him at London” and “brought him to good
termes”&mdash;most likely something much better than the £12,000
mentioned in Cavendish’s letter. Let no one henceforward <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>speak
about the purchase of peerages as if it were a modern abuse.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Burke’s <cite>Extinct Peerages</cite>, p. 427.</p></div>

<p>In the year 1628, Cavendish was created Earl of Newcastle-upon-Tyne
and Baron Cavendish of Bolsover;<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and no doubt he was made to pay a good round
sum in hard cash for this reward of “his true and faithful service to
his King and Country”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> He inherited the Barony of Ogle on the death of his mother
who had eventually become sole heiress to the dignity of her father.
He then waived any right he might have to that dignity by his first
creation (<cite>Biog. Brit.</cite>).</p></div>

<p>In spite of what we have read as to Cavendish being out of favour
with Buckingham, the letter just quoted shows that Buckingham entrusted
him with so delicate and confidential an errand as the squeezing of
money out of a candidate for a peerage. The following letter, written
a year later than the first, and shortly before Cavendish’s promotion
to an earldom, proves that Buckingham employed him also in an, if
possible, even more purely business transaction, although with the same
negotiator, namely, “my cosen Pierepoint,” who had now become Lord
Newark.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I protest to God I did use as much diligence and care
posibly I could to bringe him on.”</p></div>

<p>The business, apparently, was a proposed sale of land. Cavendish
had just begun to be hopeful of making his bargain, when Lord Newark
suddenly protested:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That he had made sollem vowe which was nott to be broken that
he would never sell that lande or part with itt any waye, and
that he had made another vowe before the Docter bought his Lande,

<p>Cavendish might well point out that there would be “sum dangers”
in opposing the will of Buckingham;<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> but, as it happened, a couple of months later
Buckingham was assassinated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Cavendish’s
son, Henry, married a grand-daughter of Lord Newark. Lord Newark
lost his life through Cavendish’s brother, Sir Charles Cavendish.
The Parliamentarians had captured Lord Newark&mdash;then Earl of
Kingston&mdash;and were taking him in a boat to Hull. Sir Charles
pursued them and demanded that they should stop and release the
Earl. On their refusing, Sir Charles ordered his men to fire, when
they unfortunately killed Kingston and his servant. They afterwards
captured the boat and slew all its crew. Kingston had strongly
disapproved of the King’s despotic measures; but could not bring
himself to join the Parliamentary party against the sovereign to
whom he owed all his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>honours: therefore he decided to be
neutral. When urged to join the Roundhead army, he replied: “When
I take arms with the King against the Parliament, or with the
Parliament against the King, let a cannon bullet divide me between
them”. On the occasion described above, when the men in Sir Charles
Cavendish’s boat opened fire upon that in which Kingston was a
prisoner, Kingston hurried on deck “to show himself, and to prevail
with them to forbear shooting; but as soon as he appeared, a cannon
bullet flew from the King’s army, and divided him in the middle,
being then in the Parliament’s pinnace, who perished according to his
own unhappy imprecation” (quoted in Burke’s <cite>Anecdotes of the
Aristocracy</cite>, vol. <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, pp. 208-9; authority
not named).</p></div>

<p>Newcastle, as we must now call William Cavendish, had a rent-roll of
more than £22,000 a year&mdash;a very large income at the then value of
gold&mdash;besides more than £3000 a year from his wife. Even with this
wealth, he found his visits to the Court very expensive and by degrees
even embarrassing, as will be seen presently.</p>

lately been considering, there is a good deal among the manuscripts

<p>“1636 (7) <span class="smcap">February. Welbeck.</span>&mdash;The

error alone. If it be a disease, it is epidemical, for such power hath

sweetness of conversation, the greatest blessing were to be an Argus or

and scape the title of ignorance since I have the luck to be astonished
in the right place, and the happiness to be passionately your humble
servant.”</p></div>

<p>Clarendon evidently thought that Newcastle’s loyalty to the King and
the Church did not proceed entirely from disinterested motives; for
he says: “He loved Monarchy, as it was the foundation and support of
his own greatness; and the Church, as it was well constituted for the
splendour and security of the Crown; and religion, as it cherished and
maintained that order and obedience that was necessary to both; without
any other passion for the particular opinions which were grown up in
it, and distinguished it into parties, than as he detested whatever
was likely to disturb the public peace”. As indeed a man with a large
estate and a large income well might!</p>

<p>The Duchess writes: “His shape is neat, and exactly proportioned;
his stature of a middle size, and his complexion sanguine”. She was
too refined to talk about a red face. “His behaviour is such that it
might be a pattern for all gentlemen; for it is courtly, civil, easy
and free, without formality or constraint; and yet hath something in it
of grandure, that causes an awful respect towards him.” Was there ever
a better description of pomposity combined with condescension? <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>“His
discourse is as free and unconcerned as his behaviour, pleasant, witty
and instructive.... He is neat and cleanly; which makes him to be
somewhat long in dressing.... He shifts,” i.e., changes his clothes,
“ordinarily once a day, and every time when he uses exercise, or his
temper” (temperature?) “is more hot than ordinary.... He makes but one
meal a day, at which he drinks two good glasses of small-beer, one
about the beginning, the other at the end thereof ... and a little
glass of sack in the middle; which glass of sack he also uses in the
morning for his breakfast, with a morsel of bread. His supper consists
of an egg and a draught of small-beer.... His prime pastime and
recreation hath always been the exercise of mannage and weapons.... The
rest of his time he spends in music, poetry, and the like.”</p>

<p>The Duchess of Newcastle was such an admirer of her husband that it
may be wise to give something more than full credit to her admissions
respecting him. Among these are that he had “not so much of scholarship
and learning as his brother Sir Charles,” that he was “no mathematician
by art,” and that he had one vice in that “he has been a great lover
and admirer of the female sex; which whether it be so great a crime as
to condemn him for it, I will leave to the judgment of young gallants
and beautiful ladies”. She also says: “He is quick in repartees”. The
uncharitable may suspect that she had frequently winced under them.</p>

<p>On 5 May, 1633, a proclamation was issued that King Charles
was about to make a progress to Scotland. Rushworth (<cite>Hist.
Collections</cite>, Part ii. p. 178) states that he left London on the
13th, that after visiting “Giddon near Stilton in Northamptonshire,
which by the vulgar sort of people was called a Protestant nunnery,” he
went to Welbeck, among other places, and that he “was treated there at
a sumptuous feast, by the Earl (since Duke of Newcastle), estimated to
stand the Earl in some thousands of pounds”.</p>

<p>Probably a very small part of this money was given to Ben Jonson
for the Masque, “Love’s Welcome at Welbeck,” which Jonson’s friend,
Newcastle, employed him in writing for the occasion.</p>

<p>Of this entertainment Clarendon says (<cite>Hist.</cite>, Book i.
pp. 78-9): “Both King and Court were received and entertained by the
Earl of Newcastle, and at his own proper expense, in such a wonderful
manner, and in such an excess of feasting, as had scarce ever been
known in England, and would still be thought very prodigious, if the
same noble person had not, within a year or two afterwards, made
the King and Queen a more stupendous entertainment, which (God be
thanked) though possibly it might too much whet the appetites of
others to excess, no man ever in those days imitated”.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>His Duchess writes of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When his Majesty was going into <em>Scotland</em> to be Crowned,
he took His way through <em>Nottinghamshire</em>; and lying at
<em>Worksop</em>-Mannor hardly two miles distant from <em>Welbeck</em>,
where my Lord then was, my Lord invited His Majesty thither to
a Dinner, which he was graciously pleased to accept of: This
Entertainment cost my Lord between Four and Five thousand pounds”.</p>

<p>In the July of the previous year (1633), Wentworth had been
created a Baron and sent to Ireland as Lord Deputy. He was not made
Lord Strafford until 1640. Among the <em>Strafford Letters</em><a
name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> are a good many from Newcastle. The first to
be noticed was written after the journey to Scotland, and it throws
some light upon the expense to which Newcastle was put by the King’s
visit to Welbeck, as well as upon the costs incident upon Newcastle’s
state attendance on the royal progress. Besides this the letter seems
to have reference to another matter. Of that matter we find a notice in
this paragraph from the Duchess’s book:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Within some few years after, King <em>Charles</em> the First,
of blessed Memory, His Gracious Soveraign, ... thought Him the
fittest Person whom He might intrust with the Government of His Son
<em>Charles</em>, then Prince of <em>Wales</em>, now our most Gracious
King”.</p>

<p>She omits to mention that her husband had specially desired this
office and that he had for a long time schemed, begged, and asked
his friends to beg, in order to obtain it. A letter from Newcastle
to Strafford shows how keenly he was longing for it, although hope
deferred was evidently making the heart sick.</p>

<p>“I heartily congratulate your Lordship’s safe arrival in Ireland....
I give your Lordship thanks for your noble and kind counsel; the
truth is, my Lord, I have waited of the King the Scotish journey both
diligently, and, as Sir Robert Swift said of my Lord of Carlile,
it was no small charge unto me. I cannot find by the King but he
seemed to be pleased with me very well, and never used me better or
more graciously; the truth is, I have hurt my estate much with the
hopes of it,”&mdash;we may reasonably infer that “it” refers to the
coveted governorship&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>“and I have been put in hope long, and so
long as I will labour no more of it, but let nature work and expect the
issue at Welbeck; for I would be loth to be sick in mind, body, and
purse, and when it is too late to repent, and my reward laugh’d at for
my labour. It is better to give over in time with some loss than lose
all, and mend what is to come, seeing what is past is not in my power
to help. Besides, my Lord, if I obtained what I desire, it would be a
more painful life, and since I am so much plunged in debt, it would
help very well to undo me; for I know not how to get, neither know
I any reason why the King should give me anything. Children come on
apace, my Lord, and with this weight of debt that lies upon me, I know
no better diet than a strict diet in the country, which, in time, may
recover me of the prodigal disease. By your favour, my Lord, I cannot
say I have recovered myself at Welbeck this summer, but run much more
in debt than I ever did, but I hope hereafter I may. The truth is, my
Lord, for my Court business, your Lordship with your noble friends and
mine have spoken so often to the King, and myself refreshed his memory
in that particular, so that I mean not to move my friends any more to
their so great trouble.”</p></div>

<p>From this it would seem that Newcastle, as well as his friends,
had very often asked the King to make him Governor to the Prince.
“Refreshing the King’s memory,” he calls it!</p>

<p>After writing at some length in the same letter about his devotion
to the King, he seems to have forgotten that he had said he would
not trouble his friends to speak any more to the King on his behalf;
for presently he rather inconsistently says:&mdash;</p> <p><span

<p>“To try your Lordship’s friends in my behalf, I humbly thank you
for the motion, and desire your Lordship to follow it. For the King’s
particular liking of my proper person, I think my Lord of Carlile would
do best, or what doth your Lordship think of his Lady, for further I
would not willingly have it go; but I assure your Lordship I am most
confident of the King’s good opinion of me....</p>

<p class="tdr">“<span class="smcap">W. Newcastle</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Considerable further correspondence passed between Newcastle and
Wentworth about the much-longed-for appointment and the most likely
method of obtaining it. Nearly a year later than the date of the above
letter, Wentworth wrote the following advice to Newcastle.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Lord Deputy to the Earl of Newcastle.</span><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></h3>

<p>“Upon the whole matter my opinion is that attending upon the
King two or three days journey after his going from Welbeck, you
should yourself gently renew the motion to the King, as one resolved
to take it only as a personal obligation from himself alone; and
therefore if His Majesty should be induced to grant that you desire,
which ariseth merely from a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>singleness of affection, you should receive
it and value it, as the highest honour you can have in this world to
be always near him. On the other side, if in his wisdom he should not
conceive it fit, you should wholly acquiesce in his good pleasure, and
beseech him to reckon you as a servant of his, ready to lay down your
life, wherever he should be pleased to require it of you; and be sure
to express it plainly, that if he in his grace toward you shall think
good to take you so near him, it shall be your greatest comfort; but to
have it by any other means or interposition, which might expect any of
the obligation from His Majesty, it would in no degree be so acceptable
unto you, that covet it not for any private bettering of your fortune,
but merely as a mark of his respect and estimation of you, and that you
might have the happiness to spend your life near that person, which
you did not only reverence as your sovereign, but infinitely love and
admire for his piety and wisdom....</p>

<p>In the year 1634, an event took place which may have made Newcastle
rather more hopeful of gaining his end about the Governorship.</p>

<p>The Duchess writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“A year after His Return out of <em>Scotland</em>, He [the King] was
pleased to send my Lord word, That Her Majesty the Queen was resolved
to make a Progress into the Northern parts, desiring him to prepare the
like Entertainment for Her, as he had formerly done for Him,”&mdash;no
very moderate request&mdash;“which My Lord did, and endeavour’d for it
with all possible Care and Industry, sparing nothing that might add
splendor to that Feast, which both Their Majesties were pleased to
honour with their Presence: <em>Ben Jonson</em> he employed in fitting
such Scenes and Speeches as he could best devise;”&mdash;this was the
masque entitled “Love’s Welcome at Bolsover,”&mdash;“and sent for all
the Gentry of the Country to come and wait on their Majesties; and in
short, did all that ever he could imagine, to render it Great, and
worthy Their Royal Acceptance.</p>

<p>“This Entertainment he made at <em>Bolsover</em>-Castle, in
<em>Derbyshire</em>, some five miles distant from <em>Welbeck</em>, and
resigned <em>Welbeck</em> for Their Majesties Lodging; it cost him in
all between Fourteen and Fifteen thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>Miss Strickland (<em>Queens of England</em>, <small><abbr
title="8">VIII</abbr>.</small> 72) thought that this royal
entertainment at Bolsover gained for Newcastle the Governorship of the
Prince. “So much pleased,” she says, “were the royal pair with the
literary taste of the earl and his royal hospitalities at Bolsover,
that they agreed in the appointment of Newcastle, as governor to
Charles, Prince of Wales.” But this is not very probable; for so long
as two years later, Newcastle was very despondent about obtaining the
appointment. He had gone to London, and his attempts to secure it had
been so much talked about that he was reported to have succeeded. This
report had even reached the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>ears of the King, and it is unlikely to
have increased his chances of success.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">1636, April 8. London.</span>&mdash;There is
nothing I either say or do or here but it is a crime, and I find a

cried me up, and so now think me a lost man. They say absolutely
another shall be for the Prince and that the King wondered at the
report and said he knew no such thing and told the Queen so; but I must
tell you I think most of these are lies, and nobody knows except the
King.”</p></div>

governor to the Prince but is gone to his government at Guernsey, and
they say is denied. My Lord of Leicester has also tried for it but
they say he is to go ambassador into France. Lord Goring also plies it
for the same place, but they say he will not get it. The Scots also
put in for it but it is not thought they will get it. It is believed
absolutely that I must be about the Prince, and some say that I am to

<p>At this date Newcastle was evidently in despair and was on the point
of going home in very low spirits. Place-hunting is not invariably
an exhilarating sport, and Newcastle was certainly a place-hunter at
this period. Some words of one of his former contemporaries (Francis
Bacon)&mdash;a place-hunter himself&mdash;are not inapplicable to his
case. “The rising into place is laborious; and by pains men come to
greater pains.... By indignities men come to dignities. The standing is
slippery, and the regress is either a downfall, or at least an eclipse,
which is a melancholy thing.”</p>

obsequious reply.</p>

<p>In Lodge’s opinion, although Windebank says the King had commanded
him to assure Newcastle that he did not owe his appointment “to any
whatsoever,” it “was most probably with Wentworth’s advice” that
the King gave it to him, which seems likely enough. It is pretty
clear that, all through, New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>castle had asked for the appointment
himself and had got others to ask for it for him. We have seen that he
sought Wentworth’s services in the matter and suggested that Wentworth
should also obtain those of Lord and Lady Carlisle. At the same time
he wanted to have the credit of having been given the appointment by
the King, solely on the King’s own initiative, without any begging
whatever, either by himself or by anybody else. Nor is it unlikely that
Strafford, knowing Newcastle’s anxiety on this point, may have inspired
Windebank to write the last paragraph of his letter, in which, with
very suspicious ostentation, he assures Newcastle that he does not owe
his appointment to any outside influence.</p>

<p>Few details exist concerning Newcastle’s conduct and experiences
as Governor of the future Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>.
On one occasion he seems to have had reasons for complaining of

have escaped the notice of Newcastle that to keep a kingdom on earth
and to lose the kingdom of heaven might also possibly entail certain
inconveniences. Newcastle continues: “and the old saying is, that short
prayers pierce the heaven’s gates; but if you be not religious, and
not only seeme so..., God will not prosper you; and if you have no
reverence to him, why should your subjects have any to you. At the best
you are accounted for your greatest honour his servant, his deputy, his
anointed, and you owe as much reverence and duty to him as we owe to
you; and why, nay justly may not he punishe you for want of reverence
and service to Him, if you fail in it, as well as you to punish us; but
this subject I leave to the right reverend father in God, Lord Bishop
of Chichester, your worthy tutor.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

<p>“But Sir to fall back again to your reverence at Prayers, so farr
as concernes reason and your advantage is my duty to tell you; then
I say S<sup>r.</sup> were there no Heaven or Hell you shall see the
disadvantage, for your government; if you have no reverence at prayers,
what will the people have, think you? They go according to the example
of the Prince; if they have none, then they have no obedience to God;
then they will easily have none to your Highness; no obedience, no
subjects.... Of the other side, if any be bible madd, over much burn’t
with fiery zeal, they may think it a service to God to destroy you and
say the Spirit moved them and bring some example of a King with a hard
name in the Old Testament. Thus one way you may have a civil war, the
other a private treason.”</p></div>

<p>There is something decidedly Machiavellian in this advice to
the Prince to worship God in order that he may himself in turn be
worshipped by his people, and in the warning against any excess
of piety, lest his people should fall into the terrible error of
worshipping their God so much as to neglect to worship their King.
Later on, Newcastle says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For Books thus much more, the greatest clerks are not the wisest
men; and the greate troublers of the world, the greatest captains,
were not the greatest schollars; neither have I known bookewormes
great statesmen; some have here to fore and some are now, but they
study men more now then bookes, or else they would prove but silly
statesmen....</p>

<p>“But S<sup>r</sup>. you are [not?] in your own disposition religious
and not very apte to your booke, so you need no great labour to
perswade you from the one, or long discourses to dissuade from the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42"
id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“The things that I have discoursed to you most, is to be courteous
and civil to everybody; ... believe it, the putting off of your hat and
making a leg pleases more then reward or preservation, so much doth it
take all kind of people. Then to speak well of every body, and when you
hear people speak ill of others reprehend them and seeme to dislike it
so much, and do not look on em so favourably for a few days after.”</p>

<p>After this come long exhortations to courtesy, and instructions as
to being agreeable to everybody without losing dignity.</p>

<p>In addition to all this advice, Newcastle personally superintended
the riding lessons of the future Charles <abbr title="the
second">II</abbr>. Newcastle was one of the finest horsemen of his
times, and, in his standard work on horsemanship which we shall meet
with later on, he says: “Our gracious and most excellent King” (Charles
<abbr title="the second">II</abbr>), “is not only the handsomest and
most comely horseman in the world, but as knowing and understanding in
the art as any man”.</p>

<p>Very many years later, when Newcastle’s pupil became King of
England, he either wrote, or caused to be written, in the Preamble to
a Patent (16 March, 1664) creating Newcastle a duke: “The great proofs
of his wisdom and piety, are sufficiently known to Us from our younger
years, and we shall always retain a sense of those good principles he
instilled into Us: the care of our youth, which he happily undertook
for our good, he has faithfully and well discharged”.</p>

<p>We are anticipating, in the matter of time, when we say that
Newcastle held the post of Governor to the Prince of Wales for about
two years only; but the Governorship may as well be dealt with finally
here. Her husband, says the Duchess, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>“was privately advertised,
that the Parliaments Design was to take the Government of the Prince
from Him, which he apprehending as a disgrace to Himself, wisely
prevented, and obtained the Consent of His late Majesty, with His
Favour, to deliver up the Charge of being Governor to the Prince, and
retire into the Countrey”.</p>

<p>In “apprehending a disgrace to himself,” and resigning the
governorship of the Prince, if Newcastle did not meet with the
“downfall” spoken of by Bacon, he at least suffered the “eclipse, which
is a melancholy thing,” mentioned by the same writer. For so short a
time, the appointment seems hardly to have been worth all the trouble
which Newcastle had taken to obtain it. How far he succeeded in it we
do not know, but one historian did not take a very exalted view of his
success.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Personal History of Charles <abbr title="the
second">II</abbr></cite>, published as an appendix to Bohn’s edition
of Grammont’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>, Sir Walter Scott says of the
Prince: “His governors, successively the Earls of Newcastle, Hertford,
and Berkshire, who had the care of his education, appear to have
afforded him but few helps towards his improvement”. The Duchess’s
statement that Newcastle “attended the Prince, his Master, with all
faithfulness and duty befitting so great an employment,” evidently
did not weigh heavily in Sir Walter’s opinion. The Prince, however,
must have gained little by his change of governors; since Clarendon<a
name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> says that Hertford, “for the office of
Governour, never thought himself fit, nor meddled with it”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> <cite>History</cite>, vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, part <small><abbr title="1">I</abbr>.</small> book vi.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"
id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p> <p>Events of greater importance than
the governorship of the Prince had begun to take place long before
Newcastle resigned it, events which eventually proved of more moment
than that governorship even to Newcastle himself. John Hampden had been
condemned for refusing to pay ship money; Prynne had been pilloried
for his writings; Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, had been suspended for
libel; and the Scottish Parliament, after abolishing episcopacy, was
preparing for war with England. Meanwhile the English Parliament was
seething with disaffection.</p>

<p>King Charles mobilised an army to proceed against the Scots. He
was sorely in need of money, and Newcastle gave him £10,000 towards
the cost of the expedition. And he did more than this. Newcastle,
says Clarendon,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> “one of the most
valuable men in the Kingdom, in his fortune, in his dependence, and in
his qualifications, had, at his own charge, drawn together a goodly
troop of horse of two hundred, which for the most part consisted of the
best gentlemen of the North, who were either allied to the Earl, or of
immediate dependence upon him, and came together purely on his account;
and he called this troop the Prince of Wales’s troop, whereof the Earl
himself was captain”.</p>

<p>Rushworth says<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a
href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that, on the
same day as the King, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"
id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>“the Earl of Newcastle marched with his
troop, carrying the Prince’s colours, into Berwick; and sent out
parties to scout upon the Scots borders. His troop consisted of all
gentlemen, most of them of very good estates, and fortunes, some
£2,000, £1,500, £1,000 and £500 per annum, and the rest of good annual
revenue; all gallantly mounted and armed, and well attended, with their
own servants well mounted; for the maintaining of which troop the King
was put to no charge at all.”</p>

<p>As everybody knows, this expedition was rendered fruitless, without
a blow being struck, by an ill-judged treaty; but it was not altogether
without adventure to Newcastle. The King’s cavalry were under the
command of the Earl of Holland, and Holland not only disliked Newcastle
personally, but was jealous of him on account of the £10,000 which he
had given towards the expedition, and the brilliant troop which he
had raised to accompany it. On a march over the Scottish border, says
Rushworth, “the Earl of Holland put the Prince’s colours, commanded
by the Earl of Newcastle, in the rear, which so offended the Earl of
Newcastle, and that troop, as his Lordship commanded Cornet Edward Gray
(brother to the Lord Gray of Wark), to take the colours from off the
staff, yet marched in order without colours”.</p>

<p>Some pages farther on,<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Rushworth continues this story. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>“The Earl
of Holland, General of the Horse, after he returned from his first
expedition into Scotland, complained to his Majesty of the Earl of
Newcastle taking off his colours from his staff in that march; the King
being also by another noble person made acquainted with the reason of
his so doing, because the Prince his colours were put in the rear. The
King commended the Earl of Newcastle’s prudence in so doing, and did
not attribute it to any unwillingness or neglect of that Earl in his
Majesty’s service on that occasion. And his Majesty commanded that, for
time to come, that troop of the Earl of Newcastle should be commanded
by none but himself whilst they remained upon duty.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> P. 946.</p></div>

<p>“Afterwards, when a peace was concluded, and the army disbanded,
the Earl of Newcastle thought fit to require an account of the Earl
of Holland for the said affront which he had put upon him, and sent
a challenge to him, and time and place where to meet appointed.<a
name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The Earl of Newcastle made choice of

name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The Earl of Newcastle appeared at the time
and place, with his second; but the General of the Horse, his second,
came alone, by which the Earl of Newcastle concluded that the design
had been discovered to the King, who commanded them both to be confined
and afterwards made a peace between them.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The Duchess says: “The place and hour being appointed by

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> “A gentleman very punctual, and well acquainted with those
errands,” says Clarendon, “who took a proper season to mention
it to him [Holland] without a possibility of suspicion. The Earl of
Holland was never suspected to want courage, yet in this occasion
he showed not that alacrity, but that the delay exposed it to notice;
and so, by the King’s authority, the matter was composed”

<p>Of this incident Kippis remarks,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> with a great deal
of sense: “Little service could be expected from an
army in which an inferior officer might challenge his
general, on account of a supposed slight in the giving
of orders; and those persons must have had strange
ideas of the laws of honour who could blame a commander-in-chief
for refusing so unsoldierly a challenge”.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Newcastle received the following letter from Sir
John Suckling, who, like Newcastle, had raised a troop of horse for the
King, and had also led it on the same fruitless expedition to Scotland.
Like Newcastle, again, he was literary and a playwright. He had been
in a good deal of active military service on the Continent, and he was
generous and amusing. If his troop of horse was only half the strength
of Newcastle’s, it must have rivalled it, if it did not exceed it, in
splendour. Aubrey says of it (<cite>Letters</cite>, p. 546):&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir John Suckling, at his own chardge, razed a troop of 100
very handsome young proper men, whom he clad in white doubletts and
scarlett breeches, scarlett coates, hatts and feathers, well-horsed and
armed.”</p>

<p>Aubrey favours us with a portrait of this correspondent, and
evidently familiar friend, of Newcastle: “He was of middle stature
and slight strength, brisque round eie, reddish faced, and red nose
(ill liver), his head not very big, his hayre a kind of sand colour;
his beard turned up naturally, so that he had a brisk and gracefull
looke”.</p>

<p>As will soon be seen, a good service which Suckling tried to do for
Newcastle, resulted rather to his detriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"
id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p> <p>After the expedition to the borders
of Scotland and the settlement of his affair with Lord Holland,
Newcastle returned to Welbeck, “to his great satisfaction,” says the
Duchess, “and with an intent to have continued there, and rested under
his own vine and managed his own estate”. As we shall find in the next
chapter, he did not rest under his own vine very long.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V</abbr>.</h2>


<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Archbishop Laud</span>,” says
the Duchess, “was pleased to tell His late Majesty, that my Lord was
one of the Wisest and Prudentest Persons that ever he was acquainted
with.</p>

<p>“For further proof, I cannot pass by that my Lord told His late
Majesty King <em>Charles</em> the First, and Her Majesty the now
Queen-Mother, some time before the Wars, That he observed by the
humours of the People, the approaching of a Civil War, and that His
Majesties Person would be in danger of being deposed, if timely care
was not taken to prevent it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps a very far-reaching gift of prophecy may not have been
necessary to foretell all this. Early in 1640, things were looking
very threatening. Both in England and in Scotland political as well
as religious disputes were causing frictions likely at any moment to
produce a flame. Charles was preparing for a war against the Scots,
and, in order to obtain a vote of supplies for this war, he summoned a
Parliament, afterwards known as the Short Parliament.</p>

<p>When it had assembled, a letter from the Scots to the King of
France, appealing for his assistance in a war which they were
contemplating against the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51"
id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>English, was produced in the House to
stimulate the loyalty of the Commons. It had little effect. Members
boldly asserted that a Scottish invasion might be a bad thing, but
that invasions by the Crown upon the liberties of Englishmen at home
were worse things still and that these home invasions ought to be
repelled before the Scottish invasion. As to either subsidies for the
proposed campaign against the Scots, or ship-money, the Commons passed
a Resolution that “till the liberties of the House and kingdom were
cleared, they knew not whether they had anything to give or no”. Pym
urged peace with the Scots, while Sir Henry Vane asked for £840,000 to
make war upon them. The Commons, and even the Lords, were in a sulky
humour, the King was now being publicly defied by his Government and he
dissolved Parliament on 5 May, 1640.</p>

<p>Charles, Strafford and Vane tried every possible means of
raising funds for the war. The citizens of London refused to
make a loan at 8 per cent. and they also refused to levy a rate.
An appeal to the King of Spain for a loan met with no better
success. There were revolutionary risings in London. Torture
was used for the last time in England upon one of the leaders<a
name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"
class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the malcontents. Presently the bishops
were persuaded to give a few thousands; Cottington managed to
borrow £50,000 from the East India Company at the usurious interest
of 16 per cent., and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>at last the City agreed to a loan of
£200,000, on the security of the Peers. Of all the Peers none was more
ready to help the King financially than Newcastle.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The position of Newcastle’s great friend, Strafford, at this
time, was intolerable. He was practically at the head of the King’s
affairs; but those affairs were in an almost hopeless condition.
There was not enough money to pay and provide for the army during a
prolonged war; there was a mutinous spirit among the soldiers; their
commander-in-chief, Northumberland, had no heart for the war; the high
officials were trembling at the responsibility of illegal action; both
the King and Strafford were in agony, the one from vacillation, the
other from gout.</p>

<p>Conway, who was in command in the North and had been incredulous
about a Scottish invasion, on discovering its reality wrote a very
doleful letter early in August to Northumberland. He complained that
he had only half the number of troops with which the Scots were
about to cross the border and that nearly a quarter of his men were
entirely unarmed. On learning the state of things in the North,
Charles issued orders to all the lords-lieutenants in the Midlands and
the North to call out the trained bands for immediate service, and,
Northumberland’s health having broken down, Charles made Strafford
Commander-in-Chief of the English army. The failure of Conway, of
Northumberland, and eventually of Strafford, cleared the way for the
employment of a man exceedingly unambitious of military service,
namely, Newcastle.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"
id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p> <p>The King left London for the North
on 20 August, 1640. On the night of the same day, the Scottish army, of
about 25,000 men, crossed the Tweed at Coldstream and invaded England.
Charles reached York on the 23rd, Strafford joined him there four days
later, and, on the 29th, the Scots took the city of Newcastle and
occupied it. Before long the counties of Northumberland and Durham were
completely in their power. Charles held a great council of the peers at
York; he announced that he was about to issue writs for a Parliament
to meet on 3 November, and he asked the advice of the council upon the
situation. The upshot of much deliberation on the part of the council,
and much negotiation with the enemy, was that a cessation of arms was
agreed upon, the two northern counties being left in the possession of
the Scots.</p>

<p>The Parliament&mdash;the notorious Long Parliament&mdash;met on the
day appointed. Within ten days, Strafford, who had taken his seat in
the Lords, was impeached and arrested. About a month later, Laud had
also been impeached and, like Strafford, imprisoned in the Tower.</p>

<p>Charles soon discovered that he was no longer governing, but
governed. The Parliament negotiated with the Scots without consulting
him or even taking him into its confidence. Eventually the Commons
voted that £300,000 should be given to the King’s enemies, the Scots,
as a “Brotherly Assistance”.</p>

<p>The King’s affairs kept going rapidly from bad to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>worse.
We cannot here deal with the trials and the executions of Newcastle’s
two friends, Strafford and Laud&mdash;for Laud also was a friend of
Newcastle&mdash;or the Root and Branch Bill, or the Grand Remonstrance,
or the Rebellion in Ireland which is said to have cost that country
nearly half its population. We shall presently have enough to do with
Newcastle himself without troubling ourselves about general politics;
but it has been necessary to take a brief survey of them in so far as
they led up to the most important events in Newcastle’s life.</p>

<p>In the years 1640 and 1641, the Queen showed more energy than the
King, but she was equally, if not even more, injudicious. At about
the period dealt with at the beginning of the last chapter, or even
earlier, by way of obtaining the advice of a sage politician, she
had listened, and persuaded Charles to listen, to the proposals of
Newcastle’s profligate, and light-minded friend, Sir John Suckling.
That courtier recommended the King to make use of his army in the North
to re-establish and maintain his regal authority: as Strafford was in
the Tower and Northumberland was still invalided, he suggested that
Newcastle should be put in command of that army, and that he should
bring it South, to overawe the Parliament and support the King. In
addition to advising the use of force, Suckling personally endeavoured
to raise loyal troops in support of the Crown. His efforts, however,
did more harm than good to the King’s cause; his plot was discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>by
the Parliament, he fled to France and he was declared a traitor.</p>

<p>Although there was no proof of Newcastle’s complicity in this plot,
the fact that his appointment to command the army of the North was
part of its scheme made the Parliament suspect him more strongly than
ever.</p>

<p>The effect of all this was that the Queen was now even more
hateful to the Parliament than was the King. The crisis arrived
when five members of Parliament began to urge that the Queen, as
the prime author of the encroachments upon the liberties of the
subjects, should be formally impeached. The King still hesitated;
but, according to the well-known story, the Queen said to him:<a
name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> “Go, you coward! and pull these rogues out by
the ears, or never see my face again”. The Queen told Lady Carlisle of
this little episode, Lady Carlisle told Essex, Essex told others, and
others told the five members, who made their escape in safety.</p>

<p>Urged on the one side by his councillors to use the utmost caution,
on the other by his Queen to be a man and to put his foot down, the
vacillating and nervous King, in a moment of spasmodic courage,
threatened the Parliament; whereupon the Parliament threatened the
King, who then practically ran away, leaving London on 10 January,
1642.</p>

<p>The first actual conflict between the King and the Parliament took
place in relation to Newcastle. When <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Charles had left York, to meet the Long Parliament in London, he had
sent all the ammunition and stores which he had accumulated for his war
against the Scots, to Hull. He had foreseen the likelihood of a civil
war, and he had privately given Newcastle a commission, appointing him
governor of Hull; but he had told him not to use it unless he received
further orders.</p>

<p>During the morning on which the King left London, early in January,
1642, one of his first acts was to dispatch orders to Newcastle,
commanding him to make immediate use of that commission, and to hurry
to Hull, as the Duchess says, “with all possible speed and privacy”. Of
what followed she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Immediately upon the receipt of these his Majesties Orders and
Commands, my Lord prepared for their execution, and about Twelve of the
Clock at night, hastened from his own house when his Familie were all
at their rest, save two or three Servants which he appointed to attend
him. The next day early in the morning he arrived at <em>Hull</em>, in
the quality of a private Gentleman, which place was distant from his
house forty miles; and none of his Family that were at home, knew what
was become of him, till he sent an Express to his Lady to inform her
where he was.”</p>

<p>The probable intense anxiety of his wife, which might so simply and
so easily have been saved, does not appear to have occurred to him. The
Duchess continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thus being admitted into the Town, he fell upon his intended
Design, and brought it to so hopeful an issue for His Majesties
Service, that he wanted nothing but His Majesties further Commission
and Pleasure to have secured both the Town and Magazine for His
Majesties use; and to that end by a speedy Express gave His Majesty,
who was then at <em>Windsor</em>, an account of all his Transactions
therein, together with his Opinion of them, hoping His Majesty would
have been pleased either to come thither in Person, which he might have
done with much security, or at least have sent him a Commission and
Orders how he should do His Majesty further Service.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Charles, his most intimate followers could not be
trusted for secrecy, and there were spies in his train. His orders to
Newcastle were betrayed to the Parliament, and, by its authority, Sir
John Hotham, who lived very near Hull, was appointed its governor and
ordered to seize it with the help of the Yorkshire trained bands under
his command.</p>

<p>Newcastle had entered Hull, had proclaimed himself its governor,
in the King’s name, and had found that it contained a larger quantity
of munitions than the Tower of London itself; but, when Legg, on
behalf of the King, and Hotham, on the part of the Parliament, brought
troops to occupy the town, the Mayor&mdash;to use a very vulgar
expression&mdash;uncertain as to which way the cat would jump, refused
to admit the soldiers of either of them.</p>

<p>“Before Newcastle had been three days in Hull,” <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>says
Clarendon,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a
href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> “the House of
Peers sent for him, to attend the service of that House, which
he had rarely used to do, being for the most part at Richmond
attending upon the Prince of Wales, whose Governor he was.<a
name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He made no haste to return upon the summons
of the House, but sent to the King to know his pleasure.”</p>

<p>As usual, Charles showed weakness. Having dispatched Newcastle
in a tremendous hurry to secure his magazines at Hull against the
Parliament, he now ordered him to obey the Parliament, to leave Hull
and the magazines to their fate, and go to London. Newcastle, says the
Duchess, “received orders from His Majesty to observe such Directions
as he should receive from the Parliament then sitting: Whereupon he was
summoned personally to appear at the House of Lords, and a Committee
chosen to examine the Grounds and Reasons of his undertaking that
Design; but my Lord shewed them his Commission, and that it was done
in obedience to His Majesties Commands and so was cleared of that
Action”.</p>

<p>Both Lords and Commons then petitioned the King to allow the
magazines at Hull to be removed to the Tower of London; and when the
King was slow in sending a reply, they ordered Hotham to dispatch them
there at once.</p>

<p>Clarendon (<cite>Hist.</cite>, vol. <abbr title="1">I</abbr>,
part <span class="smcap"><abbr title="2">II</abbr>.</span> book v.)
describes Sir John Hotham as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>“by his nature and education a rough and
rude man, of great covetousness, of great pride, and great ambition;
without any bowels of good nature, or the least sense or touch of
generosity; his parts were not quick and sharp, but composed, and
he judged well; he was a man of craft, and more likely to deceive
than be cozened.” “He had been first induced to sympathise with the
Parliament against the King,” adds Clarendon, “by his particular malice
against the Earl of Strafford;” he had been imprisoned, probably as
he suspected at the instigation of Strafford, for complaining in
Parliament at the King’s demands for large subsidies for the army;
and he had formally ranged himself upon the Parliamentary side; but
the Parliamentary leaders “well knew that he was not possessed with
their principles in any degree,” that, although he had considered Laud
guilty of treason, he was a zealous supporter of Church and State, and
that he had been “terrified” by certain votes against sheriffs and
deputy-lieutenants passed in the House of Commons. “Therefore they sent
his son, a member likewise of the House, and in whom they confided, to
assist him, or rather to be a spy upon his father. And this was the
first essay they made of their Sovereign Power over the Militia and the
Forts.” As will appear later, the son was in reality more royalist in
his inclinations than the father upon whom he was to spy.</p>

<p>Against such a usurpation of the Royal Prerogative the King made
a protest on 9 March. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>was determined to displace Hotham, and
to replace Newcastle, at Hull. In April he went North with a view to
testing the powers of the Parliament by entering Hull himself. At the
same time he was anxious to avoid all appearance of committing an act
of war. Ostensibly, he intended merely to enter Hull as he might enter
any of his other cities.</p>

<p>When Hotham was informed that the King was approaching, accompanied
by 300 men, and that there were 400 more behind them, he was “in great
confusion,” says Clarendon, “and calling some of the chief magistrates,
and other officers together to consult, they persuaded him not to
suffer the King to enter the town”.</p>

<p>Presently a messenger from Charles arrived, bringing to Hotham the
information that the King would do him the honour of dining with him
that day.</p>

<p>Bewildered almost to distraction, Hotham resolved to obey orders
which he had received from the Parliament to admit no troops whatever
without its special instructions. Accordingly he had his drawbridges
raised, and standing upon the walls when the King arrived, he
very respectfully informed him of the strict injunctions which he
had received from his employers&mdash;the Commons. Then the King
offered to come in with an escort of only twenty men; but Hotham,
knowing that there was a strong royalist spirit within the town,
was afraid of admitting him, and said that to allow even so small
a number of armed men to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>enter would be a breach of his orders.
Clarendon says: “the gentleman, with much distraction in his looks,
talked confusedly of ‘the trust he had from the Parliament’; then fell
upon his knees, and wished ‘that God would bring confusion upon him
and his, if he were not a loyal and faithful subject to His Majesty,
but, in conclusion, plainly denied to suffer his Majesty to come into
the town’”. The King’s soldiers then loudly called upon the garrison
to kill Hotham on the spot and throw him over the wall; and Charles,
having made his heralds proclaim Hotham a traitor, rode away in a
rage.</p>

<p>In the following month (May), the greater part of the arms and
stores were shipped from Hull to the Tower of London. The Hotham
incident greatly increased the irritation already existing between
the King and the Parliament; and, although war had not been actually
declared, both sides were collecting troops and stores.</p>

<p>Charles ordered Newcastle to take possession of the city bearing
his name, and also the command of the four adjacent counties of
Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham and Westmoreland. On 17 June,
1642, he entered the city of Newcastle in the name of the King. He
also secured Tynemouth Castle and he fortified Shields. The King
had now a port on the East coast at which he could receive supplies
from Holland, whither the Queen had gone to raise money for the
coming war by selling her jewels and begging for loans.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>It was all very well to be given the command of four counties; but
it was difficult to command them without men to enforce commands. The
King had indeed ordered Newcastle to make bricks without straw. As it
was, when Newcastle arrived, “he neither found any military provision
considerable for the undertaking that work, nor generally any great
encouragement from the people in those parts”. So says the Duchess; and
she adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As soon as my Lord came to <em>Newcastle</em>, in the first
place he sent for all his Tenants<a name="FNanchor_39_39"
id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and Friends in those parts, and presently
raised a Troop of Horse consisting of 120, and a Regiment of Foot,
and put them under Command, and upon duty and exercise in the Town of
<em>Newcastle</em>; and with this small beginning took the Government
of that place upon him ... and armed the Soldiers as well as he could:
And thus he stood upon his Guard, and continued them upon Duty; playing
his weak Game with much Prudence, and giving the Town and Country
very great satisfaction by his noble and honourable Deportment.” In
short, under the circumstances, Newcastle would have found it very
dangerous, when “playing his weak game,” to be anything except civil
and obsequious.</p>

inherited from his mother.</p></div>

<p>Clarendon says that Newcastle had no sooner occupied the
city of Newcastle, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>“without the slightest hostility (for
that town received him with all possible acknowledgment of the King’s

was fought, and in November there were encounters at Brentford and
Turnham Green, after which the King took up his winter quarters at
Oxford.</p>

<p>Essex, the Commander-in-Chief of the Parliamentary forces,
commissioned Lord Fairfax to command the armies in Yorkshire and the
adjacent counties; therefore henceforth Fairfax was to be Newcastle’s
principal enemy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Fairfax whose name in arms through Europe rings,</div>
    <div class="verse">Filling each mouth with envy or with praise.</div>
    </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="indent18">Milton.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Fairfax had a great advantage over Newcastle, having served with
the English army in the Low Countries, whereas Newcastle had had no
military experience. He had also the recommendation for a command in
Yorkshire, that he was a Yorkshireman both by birth and by blood.
On the other hand he laboured under the disadvantage of the intense
dislike and contempt of his fellow-Yorkshireman and brother officer,
Sir John Hotham, the Governor of Hull. There were very few “gentlemen,
or men of any quality, in that large county,” says Clarendon, “who
were disaffected to his Majesty”. The chief of these were Fairfax, the
Hothams, father and son, Cholmondley, and Stapleton.</p>

<p>We must now return to him in the summer of 1642. A special charge,
given to him by the King, was the Bishopric of Durham. In that diocese
were many sympathisers with the Parliament, and among such were not
a few of the clergy. Now <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66"
id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>Newcastle knew the Dean to be thoroughly
loyal to the King; so he issued an order that no sermon was to be
preached in the diocese until it had been written out and submitted
to the Dean; and he ordered the Dean not only to strike out anything
which he might consider savouring of disaffection, but also to put
in expressions of devoted loyalty to the sovereign, wherever such
sentiments were wanting. Besides this he empowered the Dean to punish
any of the clergy who might be in the least contumacious about the
matter. We have the Duchess’s authority for this statement.</p>

<p>In spite of the carefully doctored sermons, the Duchess tells us
that “there happened a great mutiny of the Trainband Souldiers of the
Bishoprick at Durham, so that my Lord was forced to remove thither in
Person, attended with some forces to appease them; where at his arrival
(I mention it by the way, and as a merry passage) a jovial Fellow used
this expression, That he liked my Lord very well, but not his Company
(meaning his Soldiers)”.</p>

<p>Then Newcastle set resolutely to work to raise an army. It would
be interesting to know with what weapons he armed it. The artillery
of the time was provided with very elementary guns; and the muskets,
harquebuses (carbines), and petronels (heavy pistols), all left much
to be desired. Pikes were then an all-important weapon; but pikemen
required almost more drill and training than did any other soldiers,
and it is doubtful how soon those in New<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>castle’s hastily recruited
army could have been of any effective service; but, at any rate, they
could hardly be less experienced in military affairs than was their
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Scythes, fastened to the ends of poles, we know to have been
used in the seventeenth century by the defenders of fortresses, for
hooking off soldiers attempting to scale the walls and for upsetting
scaling-ladders. Most tempting tools to use, one would imagine. Bows
and arrows were certainly carried by the Scottish army which crossed
the English border, as described in an earlier chapter, and Grose (vol.
<abbr title="2">II</abbr>, p. 272) says that one of their uses was “to
gall or astoyne the enemye with the hailshot of light arrows, before
they have come within danger of the harquebuss shot”.</p>

<p>The Duchess says that the King of Denmark sent a ship containing
arms and ammunition to Newcastle, and that, among the weapons, were
“Danish clubs”. In our twentieth century superiority, we may look
down with contempt upon clubs; but, in a hand-to-hand fight, heavy
clubs might be weapons to which considerable respect would be due, if
swung by the arms of able-bodied warriors upon the skulls of their
enemies.</p>

<p>It was another person’s opinion that Newcastle had even more than a
sufficient supply of arms and ammunition, and that he was acting the
part of the dog in the manger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Sir Marmaduke Langdale to Sir William Savile.</span><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1642, <span class="smcap">Nov. 9th, Newcastle.</span>&mdash;(My
Lord of Newcastle) hath plenty of arms and ammunitions, far more than

<p>The King was of the same opinion as to Newcastle’s superfluity of
weapons, and wrote to him asking for a supply; but he did not receive
any, and Newcastle pleaded that he had none to spare. Charles then
wrote:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a

<p>As to men, Newcastle was also successful. The Duchess
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Amongst the rest of his Army, My Lord had chosen for his own
Regiment of Foot, 3,000 of such Valiant, stout and faithful men
(whereof many were bred in the Moorish-grounds of the Northern parts)
that they were ready to die at my Lord’s feet, and never gave over,
whensoever they were engaged in action, until they had either conquer’d
the Enemy or lost their lives. They were called Whitecoats, for this
following reason: My Lord being resolved to give them new Liveries, and
there being not red Cloth enough to be had, took up so much of white as
would serve to cloath them, desiring withal, their patience until he
had got it dyed; but they impatient of stay, requested my Lord, that he
would be pleased to let them have it un-dyed as it was, promising they
themselves would die it in the Enemies Blood: Which request my Lord
granted them, and from that time they were called White-Coats;” or,
sometimes, she might have added, “Newcastle’s Lambs”.</p>

<p>She tells us in another place that <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>“Within a short time,
my Lord formed an Army of 8,000 Foot, Horse and Dragoons, and put
them into a condition to march in the beginning of <em>November,
1642</em>. No sooner was this effected, but the Insurrection grew
high in <em>Yorkshire</em>, in so much, that most of His Majesties
good subjects of that County, as well the Nobility as Gentry, were
forced for the preservation of their persons, to retire to the City of
<em>York</em>, a walled Town, but of no great strength.”</p>

<p>Before going to York Newcastle had to leave about half his army
behind him. Clarendon says: “having left a good garrison at Newcastle,
and fixed such small garrisons in his way, as might secure his
communication with that port, to which all his ammunition was to
be brought, with a body of near 3,000 foot, and 600 or 700 horse
and dragoons, without any encounter with the enemy (though they had
threatened loud) he entered York, having lessened the enemy’s strength,
without blood, both in territories and men”. Two regiments, which had
been raised for the enemy, dissolved on his approach.</p>

<p>Newcastle then settled down for the winter, “yet,” says Clarendon,
“few days passed without blows, in which the parliament forces had
usually the worst”. But not always; for, if the following statement be
true, Newcastle’s forces were on one occasion repulsed in a manner of
which the description reads like a page from <em>Don Quixote</em>.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">Sir John Hotham to William Lenthall.</span><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></h3>

set upon my son’s men at Cawood. When they came in Sherborne, a village
three miles from Cawood, they espied a windmill, which they took for

<p>When the winter set in,<a name="FNanchor_47_47"
id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"
class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Newcastle, with the King’s troops, held all
the country between York and the border of Scotland, while the south
of Yorkshire was under the control of Fairfax and the troops of the
Parliament.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> In 1642, Newcastle sent his friend, Sir William Savile, to take
possession of the manufacturing towns in the West Riding of
Yorkshire. Some interesting letters relating to Newcastle and Sir
William may be found in Hunter’s <em>Hallamshire</em>.</p></div>

<p>As no supplies came from the Government for the army of Newcastle,
he had to provide for it otherwise. The Duchess tells us how this was
managed: “It was agreed, That the Nobility and Gentry of the several
Counties, should select a certain number of themselves to raise money
by a regular Tax, for the making provisions for the support and
maintenance of the Army, rather than to leave them to free-quarter and
to carve for themselves”.</p>

<p>The seizure of York by Newcastle had been a step of the
greatest importance. Clarendon says of it:<a name="FNanchor_48_48"
id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a> “It cannot be denied that the Earl of
Newcastle, by the quick march of his troops, as soon as he had received
his commission to be General, and in the depth of winter,”&mdash;late
autumn would have been more accurate&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>“redeemed, or rescued the
city of York from the rebels, when they looked upon it as their own,
and had it even within their grasp; and as soon as he was master of
it, he raised men apace”. The Duchess says that he raised from first
to last 100,000;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> but this must surely
be an exaggeration&mdash;“and drew an army together, with which he
fought many battles, in which he had always (the last excepted,)
success and victory”&mdash;another exaggeration.</p>

<p>Although Newcastle’s seizure of York was of the utmost
importance, the King was somewhat premature in thinking that now
“the business in Yorkshire” was “almost done”. On 15 December, 1642,
he wrote (see Ellis’s <cite>Letters</cite>, series 3, vol. <abbr

<p>Something having been said already of Newcastle’s troops and
weapons, it may be well to say a little about the General who was in
command of them. His contemporaries shall describe him. Clarendon
says: “He liked the pomp and absolute authority of a General well,
and preserved the dignity of it to the full; and for the discharge
of the outward state, and circumstances of it, in acts of courtesy,
affability, bounty, and generosity, he abounded, which, in the infancy
of war, became him, and made him, for some time, very acceptable to men
of all conditions”.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Warwick,<a name="FNanchor_50_50"
id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a well-known cavalier, who knew Newcastle
intimately, bears very similar witness, saying: he “was a gentleman of
grandeur, generosity, loyalty, and steady and forward courage”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> <cite>Memoires of the Reign of King Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr></cite>, by Sir Philip
Warwick, i. p. 235.</p></div>

<p>Clarendon continues: “But the substantial part, and fatigue
of a General, he did not in any degree understand (being utterly
unacquainted with war), nor could submit to; but referred all matters
of that nature to the discretion of his Lieutenant-General King”.
Clarendon then says that when there was a <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>battle he was always
present, if it was possible, and that, on such occasions, he “gave
instances of an invincible courage and fearlessness in danger, in which
the exposing himself notoriously did sometimes change the fortunes of
the day, when his troops (had) begun to give way”. But “such actions
were no sooner over than he retired to his delightful company, music,
or his softer pleasures, to all of which he was so indulgent, and to
his ease, that he would not be interrupted upon any occasion soever;
insomuch as he sometimes denied admission to the chiefest officers
of the army, even to General King himself, for two days together;
from whence many inconveniences fell out”. As indeed may easily be
imagined.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Warwick supports this evidence. He says that Newcastle’s
“edge had too much razor in it; for he had a tincture of a romantic
spirit, and had the misfortune to have somewhat of the poet in him....
This inclination of his own and such kind of witty society (to be
modest in the expression of it) diverted many counsels, and lost many
opportunities, which the nature of that affair”&mdash;the campaign in
the North&mdash;“this great man had now entered into, required.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr>.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> said something
of the Commander-in-Chief, it may be well to notice his principal
officers. King, the Lieutenant-General, whom he placed over his
infantry, was a soldier of considerable experience. Clarendon says that
he “had exercised the highest commands under the King of Sweden with
extraordinary ability and success”. We saw in the last chapter that
Newcastle left a great deal to the discretion of King, and, considering
our hero’s total inexperience of war, it was probably well that he
did so. Some readers of these pages may feel inclined to add: Then
probably, also, any merits that were earned by Newcastle’s army were
due to King and not to Newcastle. This may, or may not, have been the
case; but, if they were due to King, he did not get the credit for
them. In fact, the result was the other way about. As everybody knows,
Newcastle finally met with disaster, “when,” says Clarendon, “those who
were content to spare” Newcastle blame, poured upon the head of the
unfortunate General King bitter accusations of “infidelity, treason
and conjunction with his country-men” (the Scots), “without the least
foundation or ground for any such reproach”. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>“Throughout the whole course
of his life,” he had “been generally reputed as a man of honour”.
Elsewhere Clarendon says that, under Newcastle, King “ordered the Foot
with great wisdom and dexterity”.</p>

<p>We will notice next the general in command of Newcastle’s cavalry,
General Goring, who had obtained that appointment chiefly through the
influence of the Queen. When he took it up, he was bitterly chagrined
at not having been made Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the North,
instead of Newcastle. Goring also owed Newcastle a grudge over the
Governorship of the Prince of Wales. Goring had set his hopes upon that
appointment, and, as we have seen, Newcastle got it.</p>

<p>Of General Goring, Bulstrode says:<a name="FNanchor_51_51"
id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> “If his conscience and integrity had equalled
his wit and courage, he had been one of the most eminent men of the
age he lived in: but he could not resist temptations, and was a man
without scruple, and loved no man so well, but he would cozen him,
and afterwards laugh at him, as he did at the Lord Kimbolton; and
of all his qualifications (which were many) dissimulation was his
master-piece, in which he so much excelled, with his great dexterity,
seeming modesty and unaffectedness, etc.”</p>

<p>Clarendon says<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that he was
a hard drinker, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>that “he was not able to resist the
temptation, when he was in the middle of” the enemy, “nor would decline
it to obtain a victory: as, in one of those fits, he had suffered the
horse to escape out of Cornwall; and the most signal misfortunes of his
life in war had their rise from that uncontrollable license”. Goring
“in truth, wanted nothing but industry (for he had wit, and courage,
and understanding, and ambition uncontrolled by any fear of God or
man) to have been as eminent and successful in the highest attempt of
wickedness, as any man in the age he lived in, or before”.</p>

<p>We come next to a general of a very different character, the
general in command of Newcastle’s artillery. It might be expected
that a general would be chosen to command artillery on account of his
knowledge of guns and their management; but Sir Philip Warwick says
that Newcastle chose Davenant as his General of Artillery because he
was a poet.</p>

<p>Aubrey has something to tell us about this warbling warrior.
He says<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a
href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> that Shakespeare
stayed “once a yeare” at the public-house kept by Davenant’s father and
mother, and the old scandal-monger adds that, “when he was pleasant
over a glasse of wine with his most intimate friends,&mdash;e.g., Sam
Butler (author of <cite>Hudibras</cite>) etc.”&mdash;Davenant would
say that he considered he wrote with the very spirit of Shakespeare
“and seemed contented enough to be thought his son”. He was very
intimate with Newcastle’s <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>friend, Sir John Suckling; and, long after
the time with which we are dealing in this chapter, he became Poet
Laureate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> <cite>Lives of Eminent Men.</cite></p></div>

<p>Like Goring, Davenant to some extent obtained his appointment by
the help of the Queen; for when she sent<a name="FNanchor_54_54"
id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a> “over a considerable quantity of military
stores, for the use of the Earl of Newcastle’s army, Mr. Davenant came
over with them, offered his services to that noble Peer, who was his
old friend and patron, and was by him made Lieutenant-General of his
Ordnance, to the no small dislike of some, who thought that a post very
unfit for a poet; in which, however, they made no great compliment to
their General” (Newcastle) “who wrote poems and plays as well as Mr.
Davenant”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> <cite>Biog. Brit.</cite>, p. 1605.</p></div>

<p>To make his staff complete, Newcastle appointed, “The <abbr
title="Reverend">Rev<sup>d.</sup></abbr> Mr. Hudson,” a “very able
Divine,” “Scout Master General of the army,” as we learn from the same
authority.</p>

<p>We find the army of the North, therefore, under a Commander-in-Chief
who was utterly inexperienced, a General of infantry who had<a
name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a> “the unavoidable prejudice, in this
conjuncture, of being a Scots-man,” a drunkard for General of cavalry,
a poet for General of Artillery, and a very able divine for “Scout
Master-General”. What could be expected of a campaign in which, at
any critical moment, the Commander-in-Chief might have “retired to
his softer pleasures” and refused to see anybody, while one of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>his
Generals might be getting drunk, another, not exactly drunk, but
“pleasant with a glass of wine,” reciting his poems or boasting of his
illegitimate birth, and a third writing a sermon?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Clarendon.</p></div>

<p>During the winter Newcastle was not idle. The Duchess says: “And
though the season of the year might well have invited my Lord to take
up his Winter-quarters, it being about <em>Christmas</em>; yet after he
had put a good Garison into the City of <em>York</em>, and fortified
it, upon intelligence that the Enemy was still at <em>Tadcaster</em>,”
a town about eight miles south-west of York, “and had fortified that
place, he resolved to march thither”.</p>

<p>The enemy had broken down part of the stone bridge which gave
entrance to the town, had planted guns on the remaining part, and
had also placed guns on a newly-made fort on a hill, near the town,
commanding the road from York. This affair is worthy of notice because,
as will presently be seen, it reflects upon the character of Goring,
the Lieutenant-General of the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"
id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“My Lord ... ordered a march before the said Town in this manner:
That the greatest part of his Horse and Dragoons should in the night
march to a Pass at <em>Weatherby</em>, five miles distant from
<em>Tadcaster</em>, towards North-west, from thence under the Command
of his then Lieutenant General of the Army, to appear on the West side
of <em>Tadcaster</em> early the next morning, by which time my Lord
with the rest of his Army resolved to appear at the East-side of the
said Town; which intention was well design’d, but ill executed; for
though my Lord with that part of the Army which he commanded in person,
that is to say, his Foot and Cannon, attended by some Troops of Horse,
did march that night, and early in the morning appear’d before the
Town on the East side thereof, and there drew up his Army, planted his
Cannon, and closely and orderly besieged that side of the Town, and
from ten in the morning till four a Clock in the afternoon, battered
the Enemies Forts and Works, as being in continual expectation of the
appearance of the Troops on the other side, according to his order; yet
(whether it was out of Neglect or Treachery that my Lords Orders were
not obeyed) that days Work was rendered ineffectual as to the whole
Design.”</p>

<p>“Ineffectual” because Goring and his horse did <em>not</em> “appear
on the West side of Tadcaster early the next morning”. Consequently the
enemy escaped during the night and went “to another strong hold not
far distant from <em>Tadcaster</em>, called <em>Cawood</em>-Castle, to
which, by reason of its low and boggy Scituation, and foul and narrow
Lanes and passages, it was not possible for my Lord to pursue them
without too great an hazard to his Army; whereas had the Lieutenant
General performed his Duty, in all probability the greatest part of the
principal Rebels in <em>Yorkshire</em> would that day have been taken
in their own trap, and their further mischief prevented”.</p>

<p>Although Goring is not mentioned by name, in the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>above
account, there can be little doubt that he was the delinquent. We know
the name of the Lieutenant-General who commanded “the greatest part of
the horse and dragoons”. Whether his conduct was due to drunkenness, or
to treachery, or to jealousy of Newcastle, does not appear. The poet,
whose guns “battered the enemy’s forts and works,” may have done better
than might have been expected on this occasion.</p>

<p>At about this period a very courteous correspondence took place
between Newcastle and the younger Hotham. The relations of the Hothams
to Newcastle are a matter of history concerning which the Welbeck
manuscripts contain many interesting and important details. Only
fragments from those manuscripts can be given here.</p>

<p>In December, 1642, Captain John Hotham, Sir John’s son, wrote
to Newcastle<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a
href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> about an exchange
of prisoners, offering to release “as many as the Earl has released,
without an exchange”. On the 27th he wrote: “Your free and noble
expressions of doing me so many great and real favours shall make me
endeavour either to requite them or be extremely thankful for them”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Portland MSS., vol. <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, 80, 84, 87.</p></div>

<p>A few days later he wrote: “With faith and honour to serve
the King and the Commonwealth is all our ambition, and to leave
that to posterity which our ancestors left us, an untainted
name”. And he goes on to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"
id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>“bewail the unhappiness of these
distractions, that hinder me from attending upon your Lordship”.</p>

<p>A week afterwards he wrote again to Newcastle: “I honour the King as
much as any and love the Parliament, but do not desire to see either
absolute conquerors.... If the honourable endeavours of such powerful
men as yourself do not take place for a happy peace, the necessitous
people of the whole Kingdom will presently rise in mighty numbers and
whosoever they pretend for at first, within a while they will set up
for themselves, to the utter ruin of all the nobility and gentry of the
kingdom.”</p>

<p>We shall presently have occasion to look at some letters from Hotham
to Newcastle written three months later. In the meantime several events
took place of considerable importance both to Newcastle and to the
Hothams.</p>

<p>In some “propositions for peace,” which the Parliament sent to the
King in January, 1643, complaints were made at “the raising, drawing
together, and arming of great numbers of Papists, under the command of
the Earl of Newcastle ... whereby ... the Papists have attained means
of attempting, with hopes of effecting, their mischievous designs
of rooting out the Reformed Religion, and destroying the professors
therefore”. Newcastle had no love for Papists. He simply took into
his army any loyal men whom he met with. But the Commons were bent
upon his destruction, and one of their “propositions for peace” was
that, in any amnesty there should be a special “exception of William,
Earl of Newcastle”.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>Although both Clarendon and the Duchess tell us that Newcastle
won nearly all his skirmishes in midwinter, 1642-3, there are what
profess to be “True Relations” to the contrary among the
<cite>Thomason Tracts</cite>.</p>

<p>“1643. Jan. 2. A True Relation of a Great Victory obtained by
Lord Willoughby of Parham against divers forces of the Earl of
Newcastle.”</p>

<p>“1643. Jan. 23. A True and Plenary Relation of the defeat given by
Lord Fairfax forces unto my Lord of Newcastles forces in Yorkshire.”</p>

<p>In February, 1643, Newcastle was informed that the Queen, having
sailed from Holland, would shortly land somewhere on the east coast
of Yorkshire, and he was ordered to meet her and to escort her to
a place of safety. One would imagine that, at this time, Newcastle
must have had more than sufficient worries and anxieties on his mind,
without having the care of the Queen’s precious person laid upon his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Her Majesty had sailed from Scheveling in a fine English ship,
accompanied by eleven transports laden with stores and ammunition for
the King; and, as a convoy, she had the protection of the famous Dutch
Admiral, van Tromp. After tossing in a storm for a fortnight, she was
driven back to Scheveling; but in a few days she sailed again and
anchored in Burlington (now Bridlington) Bay, on 20 February.</p>

<p>Two days passed without any symptoms of troops for her protection;
so she remained on board; but, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>on the 22nd, a large body of cavaliers
appeared on the hills. Newcastle, who had not known where to expect
her to land, had been rambling along the east coast; and, as soon as
his scouts brought him news of the arrival of the Queen’s ships, he
hastened to Burlington.</p>

<p>Under the protection of Newcastle by land and van Tromp by sea, the
Queen landed and got lodgings in the town. On reaching the shores of
her husband’s kingdom, she might fairly have expected some peaceful
repose after her voyage; but her rest was disturbed at five o’clock the
next morning, by the sound of heavy firing.</p>

<p>Five small ships of war, belonging to the Parliament, had entered
the bay during the night, unobserved by van Tromp, whose large ship
drew too much water to follow them into the bay. It seems absurd
that they should have been out of shot of the Dutch guns; but the
cannon of that time did not carry far. As the Parliament had voted
the Queen guilty of high treason for sending supplies from abroad to
the King’s army, Batten, the Parliamentary Admiral, thought this a
good opportunity of taking either her person or her life. She wrote
to King Charles:<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a
href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>“One of
these ships had done me the honour to flank my house, which fronted
the pier, and before I could get out of bed, the balls were whistling
upon me in such style that you may easily believe I loved not such
music. Everybody came to force me to go out, the balls beating so on
all the houses, that, dressed just as it happened, I went on foot to
some distance from the village to the shelter of a ditch like that
at Newmarket;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a
href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but, before we could
reach it, the balls were singing round us in fine style and a serjeant
was killed within twenty paces of me.” This must have been trying work
for a lady, at between five and six o’clock on a February morning, more
than an hour before sunrise, on the bleak coast of Yorkshire.</p>

mound.</p></div>

<p>When the Parliamentary ships sailed out of the bay into deep water,
on the ebbing of the tide, van Tromp had a word or two with them; but,
strange to say, he failed to capture them.</p>

<p>The captain of one of the Parliamentary ships, however, had
imprudently ventured on shore, where he was taken prisoner by some of
Newcastle’s soldiers. Having been tried by court-martial and condemned
to be hanged, he happened to be met by the Queen on his way to
execution. She asked what the procession meant and, on being informed,
she ordered him to be liberated, when he went over at once to the
King’s service. This incident is mentioned in Bossuet’s famous funeral
oration after the death of Henrietta Maria.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr>.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">According</span> to a Yorkshire tradition, recorded by Miss Strickland in her
<cite>Queens of England</cite> (viii. 98), while the Queen’s stores were being
laden and put in order of march, she stayed at Boynton Hall, a place
some two miles to the west of Burlington or Bridlington, belonging
to Sir William Strickland who, although he had received a baronetcy
from Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> was now on the side of the Parliament. Sir William
happened to be away from home, but&mdash;probably owing to the presence of
Newcastle’s troops&mdash;the Queen was received as a guest, if only as an
enforced guest, by either Lady Strickland, or by whatever person may
have been in charge of the house. Among other efforts of hospitality
for the benefit of Her Majesty, a great display was made of gold and
silver plate.</p>

<p>When the Queen went away, she expressed her excessive gratitude for
the excellent entertainment which had been provided for herself and
her train, adding that, as the Parliament was granting no subsidies to
the King, she regretted to be under the painful necessity of carrying
away with her the plate of which there had been such a magnificent
display. She said that she should look upon it only as a loan&mdash;in
fact its temporary removal would be a mere <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>matter of form&mdash;and
she left a portrait of herself as a pledge for its repayment. There
never was any return or repayment; but the portrait is stated to have
become, in course of time, at least as valuable as the plate for which
it was pledged. So says Miss Strickland who, as one of the family,
should have been able to judge; but, in making this calculation, we
doubt whether she sufficiently considered the increase in the value of
the plate during the same course of time. Silver plate of the reign of
Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> has been sold for as much as
£40 an ounce. The writer of these pages has a silver box, given to an
ancestress of his own by Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>,
and it was lately valued for insurance, by a professional expert, at
£30 an ounce.</p>

<p>The Queen then retired to York, under the protection of Newcastle.
The Duchess says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My Lord finding Her Majesty in this condition, drew his Army
near the place where she was, ready to attend and protect Her
Majesties Person, who was pleased to take a view of the Army as it
was drawn up in order; and immediately after, which was in <em>March,
1643</em>, took Her journey towards <em>York</em>, whither the
whole Army conducted Her Majesty and brought her safe into the
City. About this time, Her Majesty having some present occasion
for Money, My Lord presented Her with 3,000£ <em>Sterling</em>,
which she graciously accepted”&mdash;Charles and Henrietta seldom
“graciously refused”&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"
id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>“and having spent some time there in
Consultation about the present affairs, she was pleased to send some
Armes and Ammunition to the King, who was then in <em>Oxford</em>; to
which end, my Lord ordered a Party, consisting of 1500, well commanded,
to conduct the same, with whom the <em>Lord Percy</em>, who then had
waited upon Her Majesty from the King, returned to <em>Oxford</em>;
Which Party His Majesty was pleased to keep with him for his own
Service,” much to the loss and inconvenience of Newcastle.</p>

<p>The Queen’s presence did much for the King’s cause in Yorkshire.
Some time earlier, Sir Hugh Cholmley had been induced by his friend,
Sir John Hotham, to take the side of the Parliament; and, as a reward,
he had been made Governor of the Castle of Scarborough, a fortress of
considerable importance. But, when the Queen came, says Clarendon, he
“very frankly revolted to his allegiance; and waited on Her Majesty
for her assurance of her pardon”. He then delivered up the Castle
of Scarborough to Newcastle, who reinstated him as Governor of it,
on behalf of the King. It may be worth mentioning that Clarendon
says Cholmley had<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a
href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> “oftener defeated
the Earl of Newcastle’s troops ... than any other officer of those
parts”.</p>

<p>The Queen wrote, in a letter to Charles <abbr title="the
first">I</abbr>, on 20 March, 1643: “Sir Hugh Cholmley is come in
with a troop of horse to kiss my hand; the rest of his people he left
at Scarborough, with a ship laden with arms, which the ships of the
Parliament had brought thither. So she is ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>To some extent, the propinquity of the Queen was also influencing
the Hothams; although they hesitated to follow the example of Cholmley
by delivering up Hull to Newcastle. Sir Philip Warwick says<a
name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Queen presently after landed at Burlington Bay with good
provision of arms, ordnance, and ammunition, and was by the Earl of
Newcastle conveyed to York; and she so influenced Sir Hugh Cholmley,
who commanded the port of Scarborough for the Parliament, and old Sir
John Hotham and his son, who commanded Hull, that important garrison;
that had she been as successful in the last as she was in the first,
the whole North had been cleared, and that undoubtedly would have
turned the scale upon the South, and restored his Majesty unto his just
rights, the people unto their true liberties, and the nation unto its
former profound peace. But Hotham’s timorous temper betrayed himself
and the design.”</p>

<p>Cholmley immediately became very active in the King’s service; and,
to some extent by his assistance, Newcastle obtained command of almost
the whole of Yorkshire. The younger Hotham at about this time explained
the position of himself and his father to Newcastle, in the following
letters:&mdash;</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">Captain John Hotham to the Earl of
Newcastle.</span><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">1643. Mar. 22.</span> I have sent this other
letter to excuse me for not granting Sir Marmaduke Langdale a safe
conduct, and, to deal freely with your Lordship, he shall never have
one from me, I know him too well. For a letter to the Queen, that
I will certainly come in and at such a time, I cannot do it. This
enclosed you may show her, if you please, or burn, for your Lordship
knows that I ever said to you that I would do anything which might
further his Majesty’s service in the peace of the kingdom, and that
if the Parliament did stand upon unreasonable terms with him, I would
then declare myself against them and for him, but otherwise to leave my
party that I had set up with, and no real cause given that an honest
man may justify himself for so doing before God and the world, I would
never do it, although I endured all the extremities in the world, for I
well knew no man of honour or worth will ever think such a man worthy
of friendship or trust. For the prejudice you undergo for not spoiling
the East Riding truly you have put an obligation upon me by sparing
it thus long, but rather than your Lordship shall suffer anything of
prejudice either in your honour or affairs, I shall not desire the
thing any longer, but you may take what course you please, and we shall
do so for our defense. For Sir Hugh Cholmley and his manner of coming
in, every man must satisfy his own conscience and then all is well! All
are not of one mind.” Captain Hotham was intensely jealous of Cholmley
but dared not follow his example.</p>

<p>To this letter Newcastle would seem to have sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>a civil reply; for within a fortnight, Hotham wrote
again:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>“1643. <span class="smcap">Mar. 30.</span> I thank you for your two
letters in which you are pleased so favourably to interpret
the actions of your servant, and, if your Lordship
knew my real intentions, you would be far from
blaming me.... You have got by Sir Hugh
Cholmley’s turning, when he could give no reason
for it, but an old castle,” [Scarborough] “which will
cost you more keeping than it is worth: his captains
and soldiers are all here and have left him naked
enough.”</p>

<p>One would infer from the next letter that Newcastle
had written too hopefully to the Hothams about
the probability of a renewal of their allegiance to the
King, and that, in retaliation, Captain Hotham was
trying to shake the allegiance of Newcastle himself, by
telling him that he was distrusted by the Royalists.</p>

I will not serve the greatest Emperor.... But
now to give you a taste that all is not as you think

<p>Newcastle was evidently disturbed in his mind by
this very disagreeable news, as well he might be; for
he must have sent immediately to Hotham asking for
fuller particulars. A couple of days after the preceding
letter, Captain Hotham sent him these details:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The words were these: ‘that you were a sweet
General, lay in bed until eleven o’clock and combed
till twelve, then came to the Queen, and so the work
was done, and that General King did all the business’.
They were spoken by my Lady Cornwallis in the
hearing of Mr. Portington, a fellow cunning enough;
and this to my father and another gentleman with
many other words of undervaluing, which he said were
spoken by others.... You can expect nothing at
Court: truly the women rule all.... You have now
done great service; that will be forgotten when they
think they can shift without you.”</p>

<p>How far Hotham may have been perfectly honest
and sincere in his correspondence with Newcastle it
is difficult to determine. That there was a good deal
of truth in what he said as to Newcastle having
enemies among the Royalists and the rumours of his
living a too easy and luxurious life in a campaign, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>leaving the work of the Commander-in-Chief to
General King, is made probable by certain statements
which we have already seen in the words of Clarendon.
But both the Hothams were anxious to be on
the winning side; they were doubtful as to which side
that would be, and it seems likely that, in spite of
all the high-sounding professions in the letters of the
younger Hotham, the motives of both the father and
the son were personal rather than patriotic.</p>

<p>Later in the same month, Hotham appears to have
been trying to bring about peace, by interesting some
of the leading supporters of the Parliament, with
whom he came in contact, in favour of the King. On
14 April he wrote to Newcastle from Lincoln: “I
have not been idle since I writ last to do his Majesty
and your Lordship the best service I could, although
to bring that about I was glad to go seemingly by the
contrary. I have since I came into this town dealt
with some of my friends that they would not be so
violent against his Majesty’s service, and was bold
(enough) to promise them a pardon if they would
retire and give way, that this country might be wholly
at his devotion. The gentlemen are so considerable
that of my knowledge, if they desist, there shall not
be a man here to hold up his hand against his
Majesty.” This was very cheering news for Newcastle
and was almost enough to make him fancy that
the end of the campaign was in sight.</p>

<p>On 4 May Captain Hotham wrote to Newcastle:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>“I think you are mistaken in my father, for the
reason of his standing a little aloof is, that he so infinitely
wishes the peace of the kingdom, which he
thinks the King’s last answer tends not to, that I
know staggered him much.... It was said from a
good hand that the Queen thought much you did not
enough communicate with her and take her directions....
I confess I am in a very great strait in
these businesses, your Lordship’s wisdom can best
give directions in it.”</p>

<p>Yet the very next day Captain Hotham wrote
with others to Lenthall about joining his forces to
those of Cromwell. This, however, may have been
with the object of throwing dust in the eyes of the
Parliament; and it is the more likely because the
Parliament itself seems to have thought that something
of this sort was his object. Whitelock says:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>“Captain Hotham, being suspected by the Parliament,
was imprisoned at Nottingham, from whence
escaping, he under-hand treated with the Earl of
Newcastle.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> <cite>Memorials</cite>, p. 67.</p></div>

<p>We may as well dispose of the Hothams once for
all; albeit to do so will make it necessary to anticipate
considerably beyond the period of Newcastle’s campaign
with which we are now dealing. Although
long, the following statement of the whole affair of
the Hothams by Sir Hugh Cholmley is worth reading,
especially as the writer had been on intimate terms
both with the Hothams and with Newcastle. Yet it
may be that the statement should be taken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum grano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>salis</i>; as Cholmley probably felt considerable resentment
towards the Hothams for regarding him as a base
renegade from the Parliamentary cause in which he
had at one time shown so much zeal.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">An Original, endorsed by Clarendon ‘Sir
Hugh Cholmley’s Memorials’.</span><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></h3>

<p>“If Sir John Hotham could have been assured of
what he had done or said in Parliament, and received
into grace and favour,”&mdash;Cholmley seems to mean:
If he could have been assured that what he had said
in Parliament in the past would have been forgiven
him and that he would be received into grace and
favour by the King&mdash;“he might have been made a
faithful and serviceable person; the denying of which
(or at least answering it coldly) was a great motive
to his undertaking that employment at Hull....</p>

<p>“Sir John Hotham, when he departed from London,
gave assurance to some of his nearest friends,
that he would not deny the King entrance into Hull,
and surely had not done it, but that he was informed
by some person near the King, in case he permitted
his Majesty entrance, he would lose his head; and it
is conceived the same person did most prompt the
King to go to Hull....</p>

<p>“The Earl of Newcastle had not been long with
his forces in Yorkshire, when there began a treaty between
him and young Hotham; whom together with
his father they sought to draw to the King’s party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke Langdale, a great friend of young
Hotham’s,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> was the mover between him and the Earl;
and this was sooner laid hold on, in that the Lord
Fairfax was now made a General for the Parliament
of the forces of Yorkshire, and some adjacent counties;
which discontented old Hotham, and though the son
had as much as in reason he could expect (and more
than fell to his share), being made Lieutenant General
to Fairfax, yet he was not well pleased.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> But see Hotham’s letter of 22 March, to Newcastle, p. 89.</p></div>

<p>“The Queen’s army coming to Bridlington had
brought such a magazine of arms and ammunition,
my Lord of Newcastle’s army began to be very
formidable and young Hotham having retired himself
(and those forces which belonged to him and his
father) from the Lord Fairfax, and being then at
Beverley, began to have fresh notions of treating;
and thereupon makes a journey for one night to the
Earl at Bridlington, upon colour and pretences of a
change of prisoners; there he demanded his father
to be made a Viscount, and himself a Baron, that
they might have £20,000 in money, and a Patent to
the father to be Governor of Hull during his life”;&mdash;this
was, indeed, the very converse of the system of
purchasing peerages mentioned in an early chapter&mdash;“all
which, as it would have been granted, so probably
accepted, but that in this nick of time, Sir John
received some assurance of the Scots coming into
England, and that young Hotham (by his alliance
and friendship with the Wrays) was chosen General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>of Lincolnshire; yet both parties made this advantage
by the treaty, that as the Lord Newcastle forebore
to come near Hull and Beverley, so young Hotham,
though he had above 1,000 horse and dragoons,
did not interrupt the Lord Newcastle’s march from
Bridlington; which might easily have been done,
his army being over-charged with baggage, and the
season so tempestuous that his forces were very much
dispersed.</p>

<p>“Immediately after this young Hotham goes to be
General for the Parliament in Lincolnshire, so that
the treaty was off the hinge, till such time as he was
laid hold of at Nottingham by Cromwell, which the
father did so much resent as he did not only write to
the close committee in a menacing style for his son’s
enlargement, but was otherwise so passionate in words
and deportment that it gave the Parliament a great
suspicion of him.... In the interim young Hotham
breaks loose from Cromwell, and comes to Hull where
the father and son think it very opportune to renew
the treaty with my Lord of Newcastle; and thereupon
Sir John writes that letter, which was after (at the
battle of York) taken in my Lord’s cabinet,” i.e.
Newcastle’s, “and cost both the Hothams their
heads.”...</p>

<p>It is a matter of English history that Sir John
Hotham and his son were arrested, imprisoned for
many months in London, tried, and beheaded. And
it is a somewhat remarkable fact&mdash;journalists would
call it “the irony of fate”&mdash;that Sir John Hotham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>who had been one of the first to express a wish in
Parliament for proceedings against Archbishop Laud,
should have been executed a few days before that
Archbishop. Possibly a knowledge of this fact may
have helped to mitigate the sadness of the last days of
Laud.</p>

<p>During the months dealt with in a portion of the
present chapter;&mdash;to be exact, on the 17th of April,
1643,&mdash;Newcastle lost his first wife. It is scarcely
possible that he can have been with her when she
died; but of her illness and death, the collector of
these historical odds and ends has been unable to
discover any details.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX</abbr>.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> April Newcastle learned that the enemy’s General
of cavalry was going to leave Cawood Castle for the
west of Yorkshire; so he dispatched Goring, with a
strong body of horse, to attack him on his march.
Goring, a really able General when sober, overtook
the Parliamentary cavalry and surprised their rear by
a sudden charge, at Bramham Moor, or, as it was sometimes
called, Seacroft Moor, and completely routed
them, although their numbers were greater than his
and in spite of their being under the command of
Fairfax himself. If the Duchess’s story is true,
Goring’s Horse killed many of the enemy, and took
about 800 prisoners whom, with ten or twelve colours,
they carried to York.</p>

<p>Lord Fairfax wrote<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of this engagement: “Here
our men, thinking themselves secure, were more
careless in keeping order; and, whilst their officers
were getting them out of houses where they sought
for drink (it being an extream hot day)”&mdash;apparently
it was one of the enemy’s drunken days and one of
Goring’s sober days&mdash;“the enemy got, by another
way into the Moore, as soon as we,” and then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>candidly acknowledges the complete rout. Indeed
he says: “Some officers, with me, made our retreat
with much difficulty”.</p>

<p>This was an important victory to the credit of
Goring; but the glory of his surprising Fairfax in April
was sadly tarnished in May by his being surprised in his
turn by Fairfax. Newcastle had taken Wakefield in
April and had left it under the protection of Goring
and his Horse. The enemy quietly approached and
entered that town at night. Night is usually a bad
time, and a town a bad place, for a drunkard: be this
as it may, Goring was taken prisoner with most of his
men and horses, and the enemy “possessed themselves
of the whole Magazine, which was a very great
loss and hindrance to my Lords designs, it being the
Moity of his Army, and most of his Ammunition”.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Fairfax wrote:<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> “This appeared the greater mercy,
when we saw our mistake; for we found three thousand
men in the town, and expected but half the
number.... This was more a miracle than a victory.”</p>

<p>Pious Royalists, on the contrary, would probably
attribute their own defeat to the machinations of the
devil; and the impious modern reader may possibly
consider the victory, on Fairfax’s own showing, rather
a fluke.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards Newcastle recovered Goring
by an exchange of prisoners; but the defeat at Wakefield
very seriously hampered him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>Shortly before the disaster at Wakefield, Newcastle
had taken Rotherham by storm, and Sheffield without
opposition. Early in June he stormed and took
Howly House, a place which the Duchess describes
as “a strong stone house, well fortified ... wherein
was a garrison of soldiers, which My Lord summoned,
but the Governor disobeying the summons, he battered
it with his cannon, and so took it by force”. She
gives Newcastle great credit for his extraordinary
humanity in not killing the Governor in cold blood,
after the place had been captured.</p>

<p>The King was now becoming very nervous and he
wished for Newcastle’s help. On 18 June, 1643, the
Queen wrote to Newcastle from Newark: “The King
is still expecting to be besieged in Oxford.... He
had sent me a letter to command you absolutely to
march to him, But I do not send it to you, since I
have taken a resolution with you that you remain.
There is a gentleman, Lieutenant Markham, who
has received from you a letter, so angry, that I thought
it could not be from you, so that I have commanded
him to remain, and I hope that he will not be punished
for it, moreover ... since I am yet good-natured
enough not to send you your order from the King to
march to him, you, on your part, must not punish one
who stays by order of the Queen.... Your constant
and faithful friend, <span class="smcap">Henrietta Maria</span>.” <a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>This letter shows the conveniences likely to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>from allowing a lady to meddle in the conduct of a
campaign.</p>

<p>Newcastle let his army rest at Howly House for
five or six days. He then marched towards Bradford,
“a little, but a strong town”.</p>

<p>Very unexpectedly, Newcastle “met with a strong
interruption” on his march to the “little” town of
Bradford; for the enemy had “very privately gotten
out of Lancashire” “a vast number of Musquetiers,”
and, as all the country about Bradford sympathized
with the Parliament, Newcastle was unable to obtain
intelligence of the movements of his foes. Newcastle’s
greatest victory was to be won in the battle
which followed and the Duchess shall act as our War
Correspondent&mdash;by no means an inefficient one on
this occasion.</p>

<p>Although written of as Alderton and Atherton and
Adderton, the name of the scene of this battle is now
spelt Adwalton Moor. It is immediately to the right
of Drighlinton Station, on the branch line from Ardsley
Junction to Bradford.</p>

<p>The Duchess begins by saying that in Fairfax’s
“Army there were near 5000 Musquetiers, and 18
Troops of Horse, drawn up in a place full of hedges,
called <em>Atherton-moor</em>, near to their Garison at <em>Bradford</em>,
ready to encounter my Lord’s Forces, which
then contained not above half so many Musquetiers
as the Enemy had; their chiefest strength consisting
in Horse, and these made useless for a long time
together by the Enemies Horse possessing all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>plain ground upon that Field; so that no place was
left to draw up my Lords Horse, but amongst old
Coalpits; Neither could they charge the Enemy, by
reason of a great ditch and high bank betwixt my
Lord’s and the Enemies Troops, but by two on a
breast, and that within Musquet shot; the Enemy
being drawn up in hedges, and continually playing
upon them, which rendered the service exceeding
difficult and hazardous.</p>

<p>“In the mean while the Foot of both sides on the
right and left Wings encounter’d each other, who
fought from Hedg to Hedg, and for a long time together
overpower’d and got ground of my Lords
Foot, almost to the invironing of his Cannon; my
Lords Horse (wherein consisted his greatest strength)
all this while being made, by reason of the ground,
incapable of charging; at last the Pikes of my Lords
Army having had no employment all the day, were
drawn against the Enemies left wing, and particularly
those of my Lords own Regiment, which were all
stout and valiant men, who fell so furiously upon the
Enemy, that they forsook their hedges, and fell to
their heels: At which very instant my Lord caused a
shot or two to be made by his Cannon against the
Body of the Enemies Horse, drawn up within Cannon
shot, which took so good effect, that it disordered the
Enemies Troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hereupon my Lord’s Horse got over the Hedg,
not in a body (for that they could not), but dispersedly
two on a breast; and as soon as some considerable
number was gotten over, and drawn up, they charged
the Enemy, and routed them; so that in an instant
there was a strange change of Fortune, and the Field
totally won by my Lord, notwithstanding he had
quitted 7000 Men, to conduct Her Majesty, besides
a good Train of Artillery, which in such a Conjuncture
would have weakned <em>Caesars</em> Army. In this Victory
the Enemy lost most of their Foot, about 3000 were
taken Prisoners, and 700 Horse and Foot slain, and
those that escaped fled into their Garison at <em>Bradford</em>,
amongst whom was also their General of the Horse,
Sir Thos. Fairfax.”</p>

<p>Fairfax, after stating that the Royalist troops had
been on the very point of retreating, goes on to say:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
“Whilst they were in this wavering condition, one
Colonel Skirton”&mdash;a Colonel in Newcastle’s army&mdash;“desired
his General to let him charge with a stand
of Pikes, with which he broke in upon our men; and,
they not being relieved by our reserves (which were
commanded by some ill-affected officers, chiefly Major
General Gifford, who did not his part as he ought to
do), our men lost ground which the enemy seeing,
pursued this advantage, by bringing up fresh troops;
ours being discouraged, began to fly and were soon
routed.”</p>

Leeds with the convoy of one troop of horse. The
next day the said Earl came before Bradford, which
after the battering of forty great shot, he took, with
two thousand more of the same party the next morning,
with all their arms and ammunition.”</p>

<p>After the battle of Adderton Heath, Newcastle had
an opportunity of showing courtesy to Fairfax,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
“whose Lady being behind a Servant on Horse-back,
was taken by some of My Lord’s Soldiers, and
brought to his Quarters, where she was treated and
attended with all civility and respect and within few
days sent to <em>York</em> in my Lords own Coach, and from

days after the Earl of Newcastle sent my wife back

<p>Although he had captured his enemy’s wife, Newcastle
unfortunately failed to capture his enemy’s far
more important staff, owing to some dilatoriness on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the part of a galloper,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> “the chief Officers retiring to
<em>Hull</em>, a strong Garison of the Enemy ... My Lord,
knowing they would make their escape thither, as
having no other place of refuge to resort to, sent a
Letter to <em>York</em> to the Governour of that City, to stop
them in their passage; yet by neglect of the Post, it
coming not timely enough to his hands, his Design
was frustrated.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> So says the Duchess.</p></div>

<p>Newcastle had taken Lincoln and retaken Gainsborough,
which had been captured shortly before by
Cromwell; so altogether, at this part of the campaign,
he was a victorious General.</p>

<p>It might seem pretty safe to infer that the Duchess’s
account of the war was written from what she heard
from her husband’s lips, and it is difficult to believe
that he did not insist upon seeing it, either in manuscript
or in proof, before it was published. If this
surmise be correct, he intended, at the point in the
campaign which we have now reached, to have gone
to the South, so as to attack the enemy from the
North, while the King fought them from the South.
Ever afterwards he appears to have believed that,
had he done so, he “would doubtless have made
an end of the war”. But urgent requests reached
him from the General in command at York, as
well as from “the nobility and gentry” of the
county, to return at once to their assistance, as they
declared that the enemy was increasing in number
and power every day. His General at York stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>that, unless Newcastle came quickly, all would be
lost in the North. Hints also reached him, that if he
took his army to the South and left Yorkshire to its
fate, he would be considered to have betrayed his
trust.</p>

<p>Newcastle then hurried back to York, only to find
the enemy so weak, that it retreated before him
wherever he went, and his presence as well as that
of his troops unnecessary.</p>

<p>The question presents itself whether Newcastle
would have been wise to march to the South, leaving
such a fortress as Hull behind him, a fortress very
strongly garrisoned and containing many of Fairfax’s
best officers. It is true that the younger Hotham
had professed some sympathy with the Royalists, but
neither he nor his father had shown any definite
symptoms of deserting the Parliament. On the other
hand, it might be argued that it would have been
worth while to lose Yorkshire and the northern
counties, if by co-operation Newcastle’s army and the
King’s could have completely conquered the southern
counties, subdued London, and broken the power of
the Parliament.</p>

<p>In the early autumn of 1643, King Charles made
Newcastle a Marquess. This advance in the peerage
was of course an acknowledgment of his military
services, and had nothing whatever to do with any
purchase of the title by such a gross thing as filthy
lucre: at the same time it is difficult to forget that the
new Marquess had probably spent more in hard cash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>out of his own pocket for the King in raising his army
than would have been necessary to buy the title in
the ordinary heraldic market.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of Yorkshire were very uneasy at
the presence of the recently-mentioned strong garrison
in the south-east corner of their county, at Hull,
and they besought Newcastle to lay siege to it
and crush it, once for all, promising to raise 10,000
men to help him if he would make the attempt, a
promise which was never fulfilled. Newcastle
consented to their request, marched to Hull and
besieged it.</p>

<p>The defence of Hull under Lord Fairfax was a
very different thing from what it would have been if
the wavering, half-Royalist Sir John Hotham had still
been in command. But Hotham had lately been arrested
and taken to the Tower. Newcastle threw up
a good many batteries and fired red-hot shot into the
town. Fairfax replied to Newcastle’s fire with water,
by cutting dykes on the Hull and Humber, thus
flooding the invaders, their batteries, their guns, their
red-hot shot, and their camps.</p>

<p>And now, again, the question of marching to the
assistance of the royal army in the South of England
was urged upon Newcastle. According to Clarendon,
while he was besieging Hull&mdash;and he besieged it for
six weeks&mdash;the King ordered him,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> if he thought he
could not take it quickly, to leave sufficient troops to
invest it, and to march with the remainder of his army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>through Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex
towards London, which Charles would then approach
from the opposite side.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> Clarendon, <cite>Hist.</cite>, vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, part <small>I.</small> book vii.</p></div>

<p>Charles also told the Queen to press Newcastle on
this point&mdash;evidently he had not much confidence in
the power of his own commands! She wrote to
Newcastle: “He” (the King) “had written me to
send you word to go into Suffolk, Norfolk or Huntingdonshire.
I answered him that you were a better
judge than he of that, and that I should not do it.
The truth is that they envy your army.” <a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Newcastle sent a reply back to the King, telling
him that “he had not strength enough to march and to
leave Hull securely blocked up,” and that the gentlemen
of Yorkshire, “who had the best regiments and
were among the best officers, utterly refused to march
till Hull were taken”. This shows the state of discipline
among the King’s faithful officers at this period.</p>

<p>Besides Clarendon’s account of the King’s attempt
to draw Newcastle to the South, we have that of Sir
Philip Warwick, who acted as Charles’s envoy in
this business:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“The King, finding by these experiences in the
South, how tough the business was likely to prove,
sent me some time before into the North to the Earl
of Newcastle. My commission was, (for I had but
three or four words under the King’s hand, written
on a piece of white sarsanet to give me credit with
him) to try what he meant to do with his army; and
whether he would (when the season was) march up
Southerly and in a distinct body keep at some distance
from the King, to give a check unto the
Southern army. But I found him very averse to
this, and perceived that he apprehended nothing more
than to be joined to the King’s army, or to serve
under Prince Rupert; for he designed himself to be
the man that should turn the scale, and to be a self-subsisting
and distinct army, wherever he was, which,
when I perceived fixed in him, being left to discretion,
I thought it more reasonable to wave it, than press
him to the contrary.... He told me that, when he
could quit Yorkshire, and leave it in a condition to
defend itself against the aforementioned enemies in
it, he would march through Lincolnshire and recruit
himself there, and so over the Washes into Norfolk
and Suffolk and the associated counties; which had
been a noble design.” After mentioning a disaster
which later on befell Newcastle and the prospects
of King Charles, Warwick adds: “which if he had
pursued that design of marching into their associated
counties, it had prevented; so as he had a natural
foresight, from whence his danger should arise; but
not a good angel or genius to divert it”.</p>

London: Ri. Chiswell, 1701.</p></div>

<p>It was all very well for Newcastle to talk about his
projects when he should be able to quit Yorkshire and
leave it in a condition to defend itself; but very soon
he was not in a position to do either.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>On 10 October, Manchester, Fairfax, and Cromwell
defeated a force which Newcastle had collected
in Lincolnshire. According to Whitelock,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> “The Earl
of Manchester took in Lincoln upon surrender, and
therein 2500 armes, 30 colours, 3 pieces of cannon”.
The same authority states that: “The Lord Fairfax
beat from about Hull part of the King’s,” i.e. Newcastle’s,
“forces, took from them 9 pieces of cannon,
of which one was a demy-culverin, one of those which
they called ‘the Queen’s Gods,’ and 100 arms....
Colonel Cromwell routed 7 troops of the King’s horse
in Lincolnshire under Colonel Hastings.” Newcastle
was then obliged to raise the siege of Hull, much to
the disappointment and alarm of the “nobility and
gentlemen of Yorkshire”; and he marched back to
York.</p>

<p>Of the state of the war after this event Clarendon
says:<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> “Albeit the Marquis of Newcastle had been
forced to rise as unfortunately from Hull, as the King
had been from Gloucester, yet he had still a full
power over Yorkshire, and a greater in Nottinghamshire
and Lincolnshire than the Parliament had”.
The latter part of this statement is rather surprising
when we consider the recent defeat of Newcastle’s
forces in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>In ending this chapter we will notice a letter from
the Queen to Newcastle, written on 7 October, just
before he raised the siege of Hull, in which the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>matter of the Governorship of the Prince crops up
again.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>“There is one thing about which I want to be
informed by you before doing it. The Marquis of
Hertford desires to be made groom of the stole to the
King. If that be, he must cease to be governor to
Prince Charles, so that we must place some one else
about Prince Charles, which I do not wish to do,
without first knowing whether you wish to have it
again.” Presently she says (if he does not wish for
it again): “there are two other places and I desire to
know which would be most agreeable to you, for I
have nothing in my thoughts so much as to show you
and all the world the esteem in which I hold you,

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> had not been many days in York, when
he heard a rumour that the enemy was advancing
from the South into Derbyshire, and he marched
thither at once, that is to say early in November, 1643.
He posted some troops in different parts of the county,
and fortunately he met with no serious opposition. On
the contrary, he was able to raise a considerable force
both of cavalry and of infantry. The rumour of the
advance of an army from the South proved groundless,
and he went peacefully to his own houses of Bolsover
and Welbeck, where he stayed for a little time, making
them his winter quarters.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the pleasures of his hearth and home
were marred by the arrival of some very unwelcome
information,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> namely, that the Scots were about to invade
England with a large army, which was to fight
on the side of the Parliament. This was serious
news, indeed, to the Commander-in-Chief of the
Royalist army in the North of England, which would
necessarily be called upon to check the invasion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> Kippis states that he was at Welbeck when he received this
news.</p></div>

<p>“At this time,” <a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> we read in Clarendon, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>“nothing
troubled the King so much as the intelligence he received
from Scotland, that they had already formed
their army, and resolved to enter England in the
winter season.... The circumstance of the time
made the danger of the invasion the more formidable;
for the Earl of Newcastle, lately created a Marquis,
had been compelled with his army, as much by the
murmours and indisposition of his officers, as by the
season of the year, to quit his design upon Hull, and
to retire to York.” Clarendon adds that the garrison
at Hull had “made many strong infalls into the country
and defeated some of his” (Newcastle’s) “troops”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83_83" id="Footnote_83_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> <cite>Hist.</cite>, vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, part <small><abbr title="1">I</abbr>.</small> bk. vii.</p></div>

<p>The report of the expected advance of an army
from Scotland greatly alarmed the nervous “nobility
and gentry of Yorkshire,” who sent to implore
Newcastle to return to their assistance, once more
promising to raise 10,000 men to strengthen his army.
Newcastle marched back to York,&mdash;not to please the
nobility and gentry of that county, who had promised,
and yet failed to provide, a force of 10,000 men
for him, on a former occasion&mdash;but because it was
necessary to proceed to York on his way North against
the Scots. When he reached York, he found that the
nobility and gentry had not raised so much as a single
man to add to his army. Therefore he had himself to
raise what men he could for the defence of the county,
when he was actually on his march towards the North
against the enemy.</p>

<p>The military situation was now greatly changed.
Hitherto the Parliamentary army had lain between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>King in the South and Newcastle in the North. If
Hull could have been taken and its garrison captured,
Newcastle would have marched to the South and the
army of the Parliament would soon have been attacked
on both sides at once. Now, on the contrary,
it was Newcastle who was likely to be attacked on
both sides at once, by the Scots from the North and
by Fairfax from the South.</p>

<p>On 19 January, 1644, the Scottish army of 21,000
men crossed the border and Newcastle marched to
the city from which he took his title. He came there
in February, and on the 13th he wrote<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to the King,
announcing his arrival there, and stating that he had
had to march his army through thawing snow and
floods. He added that, the day after his arrival, the
Scots attacked the town; but that the town’s soldiers
were very faithful and drove the enemy a mile from
its walls. He lamented that he would not be able to
take more than 5000 foot and 3000 horse into the field,
or 8000 in all, against the enemy’s 20,000 or more;
and he complained of want both of arms and of
ammunition.</p>

<p>According to the Duchess, the Scottish General
was ignorant of Newcastle’s arrival, expected no
opposition, consequently approached the town incautiously
and was repulsed with considerable loss.
She writes as to what immediately followed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Enemy being thus stopt before the Town,
thought fit to quarter near it, in that part of the
Country; and so soon as my Lords Army was come
up, he” (i.e., Newcastle) “designed one night to have
fallen into their Quarter; but by reason of some neglect
of his Orders in not giving timely notice to
the party designed for it, it took not an effect answerable
to his expectation. In a word, there were three
Designs taken against the Enemy, whereof if one
had but hit, they would doubtless have been lost; but
there was so much Treachery, Jugling and Falshood in
my Lord’s own Army” (were the poets and the divines
quarrelling?) “that it was impossible for him to be
successful in his Designs and Undertakings. However,
though it failed in the Enemies Foot-Quarters,
which lay nearest the Town; yet it took good effect
in their Horse Quarters, which were more remote; for
my Lord’s Horse, Commanded by a very gallant and
worthy Gentleman”&mdash;can this have been the reinstated
Goring?&mdash;“falling upon them, gave them such
an Alarm, that all they could do, was to draw into the
Field, where my Lord’s Forces charged them, and in
a little time routed them totally, and kill’d and took
many Prisoners, to the number of 1500.”</p>

<p>Whitelock gives a slightly different account of this
affair. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>“The Scots besieged Newcastle, and took a
main outwork, and beat back the enemy sallying out
upon them. The Marquess of Newcastle being in
the town, burnt a hundred houses in the suburbs; the
inhabitants clamour against him. Seven of the Parliamentary
frigates lay in the mouth of the haven
to stop their passage by seas. The Marquess ordered
the firing of the coal-mines, but that was prevented by
General Leslie’s surprising of all the boats and vessels.”</p>

<p>The Scots withdrew; but they went Southwards
and got into Newcastle’s rear. Both armies man&oelig;uvred
against each other in various parts of the county
of Durham, for some time, without coming into actual
collision, the Scots seeming anxious to avoid an engagement;
indeed their failure to take an immediate
initiative with their large preponderance in numbers
was the cause of much discontent and grumbling
among the supporters of the Parliament in London.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion, we have seen the King
desiring that Newcastle should march his army to
the support of that in the South. The tables were
now turned. On 16 February, Newcastle wrote
to Charles, urging him to send troops to the North
against the powerful Scottish army, and expressing a
strong opinion that, unless reinforcements were sent
thither, and sent very speedily, the King would be in
danger of losing his crown.</p>

<p>Some desultory fighting took place in the beginning
of March, of which Newcastle gave an account to the
King; and, as a specimen of his military dispatches,
parts of it shall be given here. They can be read, or

have happened in these (northern) parts since my last
to your Majesty; with the reason of the impossibility
of making good the Tyne against the Scots.... Sir
Thos. Riddell sent about 50 musketeers from Tynemouth
Castle to destroy some corn in the enemies’
quarters, from whence they were drawn out, as he
was informed: But it seems his intelligence betrayed
them to the enemy and about 45 of them were taken
prisoners, who being carried to Leslie (Earl of Leven)
he sent them to me as a token, and I returned him
thanks for his civility, with this answer, that I hoped
very shortly to repay that debt with interest, which I
did in a few days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Colonel Dudley from his quarters about Prudhoe
marched over the river with some horse and dragoons
and fell into a quarter of the enemy’s in Northumberland,
and slew and took all that was in it, 55 prisoners,
and gave such an alarum to four of their
quarters that they quitted them in disorder and with
some loss; in which (skirmish) we should have suffered
no loss at all, had not Colonel Brandling been
taken prisoner through the unfortunate fall of his
horse; and Colonel Dudley perceiving a greater force
preparing to assult him, retreated, and in his retreat
took 8 of the Scots prisoners, both horses and men, but
they took 4 of his dragoons, whose horses were so
weak they could not pass the river.... Upon Wednesday
the 6th inst. at one o’clock afternoon our first
troops passed Newbridge, and a while after the enemy
appeared with some horse; when they advanced toward
us with more than they first discovered, after
some bullets had been exchanged, and they appeared
again in greater force, we backed our party with
Lord Henry (Percy’s) regiment,&mdash;Lieutenant Colonel
Schrimsher (Scrimegour) commanding them&mdash;being
part of Colonel Dudley’s brigade, with which he drew
up after them, with whom also we sent some musketeers;
which caused the enemy that day to look
upon us at a farther distance.”</p>

<p>It would appear much to Newcastle’s credit that he
was able to man&oelig;uvre for some time against an army
nearly three times the size of his own, were it not
doubtful whether the credit was not due to King (Lord
Ethyn), to whom he is known to have left much of
the work which should properly have been done by
himself. As to his other generals they seem to have
been Newcastle’s chief source of weakness. Here is
a story of disaster told by the Duchess:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A great misfortune befel My Lords Forces in
<em>Yorkshire</em>; for the Governour whom he had left
behind with sufficient Forces for the defence of that
Country, although he had orders not to encounter the
Enemy, but to keep himself in a defensive posture;
yet he being a man of great valour and courage, it
transported him so much that he resolved to face the
Enemy, and offering to keep a Town that was not
tenable, was utterly routed, and himself taken prisoner,
although he fought most gallantly.”</p>

<p>Of this affair, Whitelock gives a fuller account:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Lord Fairfax, and Sir Thomas Fairfax his
son, joining together, drew up their forces at Selby,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
where a garrison of the King’s was, and in it Colonel
Bellasis the Governor of York; that night they beat
in a party of the enemy’s horse and took divers
prisoners.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> About a dozen miles south of York.</p></div>

<p>“Early the next morning they beset the Town in
three divisions, and after a hot fight, wherein both
parties performed brave service, Fairfax routed them,
and entered the town, where they took 4 Colonels,
4 Majors, 20 Captains, 130 inferior officers, 1,600
common soldiers, 4 brass pieces of ordnance, powder,
match, 2,000 arms, 500 horse, besides colours, and a
pinnace, and ships in the river, and 500 more prisoners
at Hemcough near Selby.”</p>

<p>“The Earl of Newcastle, troubled at the news of
Selby, and his army waiting upon the approach of
the Scots towards them, they left Durham to the
Scots and General Leslie pursued them.”</p></div>

<p>The forces of Newcastle were hard pressed throughout
their return to York. The Duchess’s account
says that Newcastle’s rear had to fight the enemy
every day of the journey; but that the retreat was
made in excellent order.</p>

<p>News of Newcastle’s retreat to York caused great
disappointment among the Royalists at Court, and
his enemies took the opportunity of blaming his
whole conduct of the war. These complaints were
conveyed to him in letters by his friends. Their effect <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
upon him was so great that he lost heart and, as is
pretty evident from the following letter, he had written
to the King expressing a wish to resign his command.</p>

<p>The question presents itself whether the tongues
and pens of those who were dissatisfied with New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>castle’s
conduct of the campaign in the North, spoke
and wrote with no foundation for dissatisfaction. Perhaps
both the blame and the praise which were his
due are pretty fairly allotted on one of the pages of
Hume:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>“Newcastle,” he says, “the ornament of the Court
and of his order, had been engaged, contrary to the
natural bent of his disposition, into these military
operations, merely by a high sense of honour, and a
personal regard to his master. The dangers of the
war were disregarded by his valour; but its fatigues
were oppressive to his natural indolence. Munificent
and generous in his expense, polite and elegant in
his taste, courteous and humane in his behaviour, he
brought a great accession of friends and of credit to
the party which he embraced.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Undoubtedly this is true. His own expenditure
upon the war was enormous, as the Duchess assures us
and as contemporary writers testify; and his personal
influence brought many great men, followed by large
numbers of their servants, dependants and tenants,
into the Royalist army. Again, his “humane behaviour”
made him and his army popular in the
counties which they occupied, a condition as important
as difficult of attainment in a civil war.</p>

<p>Hume continues: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>“But amidst all the hurry of
action, his inclinations were secretly drawn to the
soft arts of peace, in which he took delight; and the
charms of poetry, music, conversation, often stole him
from his rougher occupations. He chose Sir William
Davenant, an ingenious poet, for his lieutenant general”&mdash;“as
one of his lieutenants generals” would
have been more accurate&mdash;“The other persons, in
whom he placed confidence, were more the instruments
of his refined pleasures, than qualified for the
business which they undertook. And the severity
and application, requisite to the support of discipline,
were qualities in which he was entirely wanting.”</p>

<p>Very probably these defects were more accountable
for Newcastle’s failures than “the juggling, falsehood
and treachery in his army and amongst some of his
officers” of which his Duchess was fond of complaining.
And it is more than likely that Granger was
right in saying that Newcastle “was much better
qualified for a court than a camp”.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Not the less should it be remembered that Newcastle
was vastly outnumbered by his enemy from
Scotland and that his troops which he had left in his
rear had been defeated by his enemy in the South.
Under such conditions even Napoleon would have
been in difficulties.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the year 1644 five Irish regiments were
landed at Mostyn, on the north coast of Wales, to
join the Royalist army, and probably that part of
it under the command of Newcastle. They were unopposed
as they marched through Wales, Chester,
and a great portion of the county of Cheshire. But
when they reached Nantwich, some seventeen miles
to the south-east of Chester, they found it strongly
garrisoned. They had not long laid siege to it, when
Sir Thomas Fairfax, the son of Lord Fairfax, arrived
with a superior force, and, after a stubborn battle of
two hours, routed them. Thereupon nearly half of the
Irish regiments “turned their coats” and joined the
Parliamentary army under Sir Thomas Fairfax, who
then, considerably strengthened in numbers, was free
to join his forces with those of his father in Yorkshire.
This made the position of Newcastle much more precarious.
He must have written to the King asking
for reinforcements, for Charles replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, general interest was concentrated on the
war in the South. Essex and Waller, each with a large
force, were endeavouring either to enclose the army
of the King, or to besiege him in Oxford. Knowing
his inferiority in numbers, Charles avoided a battle,
and partly by man&oelig;uvring, and partly owing to the
mutual jealousy of Essex and Waller which prevented
them from acting in concert, the King managed to
escape them, after fighting one or two unimportant
and indecisive actions. His position was now one of
great jeopardy, and it was just then that he received
the disheartening news of the defeat at Selby and
Newcastle’s enforced retreat to York, with his request
to be relieved of his command.</p>

<p>At York Newcastle soon found himself closely invested.
Our female War Correspondent shall tell us
what she knew about it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>“My Lord being now at <em>York</em>, and finding three
Armies against him, <i>viz.</i> the Army of the <em>Scots</em>, the
Army of the <em>English</em> that gave the defeat to the
Governour of <em>York</em>, and an Army that was raised out
of associate Counties,”&mdash;this is a little premature; as
the army of the Associated Counties did not arrive for
several weeks&mdash;“and but little Ammunition and Provision
in the Town; was forced to send his Horse
away to quarter in several Counties, <i>viz.</i> <em>Derbyshire</em>,
<em>Nottinghamshire</em>, <em>Leicestershire</em>, for their subsistence,
under the Conduct of his Lieutenant-General of the
Horse, My dear Brother, Sir <em>Charles Lucas</em>, himself
remaining at <em>York</em>, with his Foot and Train for the
defence of that City.” Clarendon, however, says that
Newcastle’s object in sending his Lieutenant-General
of the Horse (Goring, of course), with a large body of
cavalry, was “to remain in those places he should find
most convenient, and from whence he might best
infest the enemy.” In carrying out these instructions,
Goring, at first, not only met with some success, but
at the same time raised additional forces on his
marches, and money also, as we learn from the following
State Paper.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>“Proceedings at the Committee of both kingdoms....
To advertise the Earl of Manchester of the
great damage done to cos. Leicester, Stafford and
those parts, by the Earl of Newcastle’s horse, which,
coming from York, have raised 1,000 horse, and
£10,000.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Newcastle has “now about 3,000 horse and
dragoons near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, which we
hear with 1,000 horse might have been wholly prevented.
They still increase their force, raise much
money, and ruin those that depend on protection from
the Parliament.” Evidently Goring, to use an expression
of the Duchess, “carved for himself” in the
districts in which he was campaigning.</p>

<p>It was as much as Newcastle could do to withstand
the siege of York. His biographer says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Enemy having closely besiedged the City
on all sides, came to the very Gates thereof, and
pull’d out the Earth at one end, as those in the
City put it in at the other end; they planted their
great Cannons against it, and threw in Granadoes
at pleasure: But those in the City made several
sallies upon them with good success. At last, the
General of the associate Army of the Enemy, having
closely beleaguer’d the North side of the Town,
sprung a Mine under the wall of the Mannor-yard,
and blew part of it up; and having beaten back the
Town-Forces (although they behaved themselves very
gallantly) enter’d the Mannor-house with a great
number of their men, which as soon as my Lord
perceived, he went away in all haste, even to the
amazement of all that were by, not knowing what he
intended to do; and drew 80 of his own Regiment of
Foot, called the White-Coats, all stout and valiant
Men, to that Post, who fought the Enemy with
that courage, that within a little time they killed and
took 1500 of them; and My Lord gave present order
to make up the breach which they had made in the
wall; Whereupon the Enemy remain’d without any
other attempt in that kind, so long, till almost all
provision for the support of the soldiery in the City
was spent, which nevertheless was so well ordered by
my Lords Prudence, that no Famine or great extremity
of want ensued.”</p>

<p>No famine or great extremity, perhaps, for the
moment. Nevertheless, Newcastle was becoming
very anxious, and, at the least, foresaw both famine
and great extremity facing him in the near future.
Clarendon tells us that “he sent an express to the
King to inform him of the condition he was in”;
and to let him know “that he doubted not to defend
himself in that post, for the term of six weeks or
two months; in which time he hoped his Majesty
would find some way to relieve him”. Newcastle
was well aware that the King would know of his
objection to having his army joined to that of Rupert,
an objection proceeding from something near akin
to jealousy; so, now that he was in a strait, and
practically begging for Rupert’s help, since it was the
only help available, he thought it wise to write to
Charles “that he hoped his Majesty did believe
that he would never make the least scruple to obey
the grandchild of King James”.</p>

<p>Charles, in fact, had already sent Prince Rupert
northwards with the relief of Newcastle as his
ultimate object. Having marched for his quarters at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>Shrewsbury, Rupert had taken by surprise the strong
Parliamentary forces that were investing Newcastle’s
garrison at Newark-upon-Trent, in Nottinghamshire,
and had compelled them to raise the siege. He had
then marched westward and taken Stockport, Bolton,
and Liverpool. The message from the King, ordering
him to proceed at once to the relief of York,
reached him when he had raised the siege of Latham
House, which had been gallantly defended by the
brave Lady Derby for more than four months.</p>

<p>Like Newcastle, Rupert had enemies at Court: like
Newcastle again, he was anxious to be relieved of his
command, and this just at the time when Newcastle
was asking for his assistance. Once more, as in
the case of Newcastle, Rupert’s rivals were urging
the King to recall him.</p>

<p>Things were going badly with Newcastle. Whitelock
says: “A battery was made at the Windmill-Hill
at York, five pieces of ordnance planted, which shot
into the town, and did much hurt. The Lord Eglinton,
with four thousand Scots, entered some of the gates.
A strong party sallying out of the city was beaten
back with loss. General Leven with his regiment
took a fort from the enemy, and in it 120 prisoners.
The garrison burnt up much of the suburbs.”</p>

<p>According to Whitelock,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Newcastle made an attempt
to leave York. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>“The Earl of Newcastle, Sir
Thomas Widderington, and other chief commanders
with a strong party sallied out of the town, endeavouring
to escape, but were driven back into the city.” It
is most unlikely that Newcastle was “endeavouring to
escape” and to desert York in its extremity. The
probability is that he was only making a sally upon
the enemy’s forces.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> P. 86.</p></div>

<p>Whitelock makes another statement. He says:<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
“The Earl of Newcastle desired a treaty, which was
admitted, and he demanded to march away with bag
and baggage, and arms, and drums beating, and
colours flying, and that all within the town should
have liberty of conscience, the Prebends to enjoy their
places, to have Common Prayer, organs, surplice
hoods, crosses, etc.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> P. 87.</p></div>

<p>It is almost incredible that in return he would have
promised to take no farther part in the war. But
even if he and his army were to continue to fight
for the King, he would have been offering to surrender
the highly important fortress of York. It is far
more likely that he was endeavouring to delay the
siege operations of the enemy by parleys and negotiations,
while awaiting the arrival of Rupert.</p>

<p>His conditions, however, were “denied by the
Parliament’s Generals; but they offered the Earl of
Newcastle that he and all his commanders should go
forth on horseback with their swords and the common
soldiers with staves in their hands, and a month’s pay,
and all else to be left behind them”.</p>

<p>This obviously meant the disarmament of the troops,
which one would have expected Newcastle to have</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>instantly refused; but, says Whitelock, “the enemy
desired four or five days to consider thereof which was
granted,” and this, if true, has an ugly sound. But
every day of armistice was of value to Newcastle,
when a force was known to be coming to his relief,
and he may have seized the opportunity for
delay.</p>

<p>Besides the large Scottish army, and the troops
under Lord Fairfax, Newcastle was to be besieged
before long by the army that had been raised against
the King in what were known as the Associated
Counties, namely Essex, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk,
Bedford and Huntingdon. This army had been
placed under the command of the Earl of Manchester
who, when Lord Kimbolton, had been impeached by
Charles at the same time as the Five Members. His
General of the Horse&mdash;or it might almost be said his
second in command&mdash;was Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>Manchester was a rigid Presbyterian. Warwick
says of him:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Earl of Manchester, formerly known by the
name of Lord Kimbolton, was a gentleman of very
good parts, and of very good education, both at home
and abroad, and of a debonnaire nature, but very facile
or changeable.... With all his good nature, or the
facility of it, he did as much harm as the worst-natured
man could have done. And therefore it was supposed,
though he seemed the head, he was but the instrument
of Mr. Cromwell, who made great ravage
in all those associated counties on the King’s
party.”</p>

<p>Cromwell’s character is too well known to need

let us hear what he has to say about the most formidable
enemy against whom Newcastle ever fought a

<p>“I have no mind to give an ill character of Cromwell;
for, in his conversation with me, he was ever
friendly; though at the latter end ... he was sufficiently
frigid. The first time that ever I took notice
of him was in the beginning of the Parliament held
in November, 1640, when I vainly thought myself a
courtly young gentleman, (for we courtiers valued
ourselves much upon our good clothes). I came one
morning into the House well clad, and perceived a
gentleman speaking (whom I knew not) very ordinarily
apparelled; for it was a plain cloth suit, which
seemed to have been made by a country tailor; his
linen was very plain and not very clean ... his hat
was without a band, his stature was a good size, his
sword stuck close to his side, his countenance swollen
and reddish, his voice sharp and untuneable.... Yet
I lived to see this very gentleman, whom out of no
ill-will I thus describe, by multiplied good successes,
and by real (but usurped) power (having had a better
tailor and more converse among good company) ...
appear of a great and majestic deportment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“... Whilst I was about Huntingdon, visiting
old Sir Oliver Cromwell, his uncle and godfather, at
his house at Ramsey, he told me this story of his
successful nephew and godson; that he visited him
with a good strong party of horse, and that he asked
him his blessing, and that, the few hours he was there,
he would not keep on his hat in his presence; but, at
the same time, he not only disarmed but plundered
him; for he took away all his plate.” As we are
aware, there was a royal precedent for robbing a host
of his plate.</p>

<p>Among the State Papers, there are a good many
dispatches from the Parliamentary army in the North
at this (to Newcastle) very critical time. The first to
be quoted tells us the strength of the force which
Rupert was said to be taking to the relief of Newcastle.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

Sir Thomas Fairfax and Major-General (David) Leslie
are in full pursuit of Prince Rupert’s Army, deeply
engaged in a country full of difficult passages for
ordnance and carriages. Rupert’s forces are divided
into two bodies, the Marquis of Newcastle’s horse, not
exceeding 3,000 as I am credibly informed, and 100
foot, without ordnance, lying upon the frontiers of
Yorkshire, betwixt Woodhead and Stopford; and the

<p>“<span class="smcap">Selby. The Earl of Manchester to the Committee
of both kingdoms</span> ... I can assure you that
I took all care to bring on an engagement with the
Duke of Newcastle’s horse which came from York,
but they would not stay within 20 or 30 miles of
where my horse were. The time they employed in
plundering about Leicester, most part of my horse
were on this side Trent, unable to move by reason of
the heavy rains. As soon as they had notice that
Major-General Leslie and my horse were moving
towards Nottingham, thinking to intercept them in
their march northward, they marched in such hot
haste toward Uttoxeter that they left great numbers
of their horse dead on the highways, passing the
Trent at Burton, and so got into Derbyshire. Sir
Thos. Fairfax was sent with directions to engage
Newcastle’s horse, we having intelligence that they
were coming toward Sheffield and Rotherham, but
as soon as our horse were within 7 or 8 miles of
them, they presently marched into those parts of the
country in which it would be very difficult to pursue
them.”</p>

<p>Although Goring was not strong enough to engage
his enemy at this time, he was doing good service by
delaying the juncture of the army of the Associated
Counties with the Scottish army before York. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>a time came when he could delay that juncture no
longer.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir Harry Vane, Junr., to the Committee of
both kingdoms Leaguer before York</span>.... It appears
to me very evident that if Manchester had not brought
up his foot to the siege the business would have been
very dilatory, whereas the siege is now made very
straight about the city, the Earl’s forces lying on the
North side, where they have advanced very near
the walls, and are busy in a mine of which we expect
a speedy account, if by a treaty we be not prevented.
The Scotch forces under Sir James Lumsdale’s
(Lumsden’s) command united with those of Lord
Fairfax, possess the suburbs at the East side, and
are within pistol shot and less of Walmgate.”</p>

<p>In the later part of the same dispatch, Sir Harry
Vane notices the “parley” mentioned by Whitelock.
He only dwells upon a matter of etiquette, which turned
upon the question whether Newcastle did not put
Manchester’s name on the direction of a letter, through
literal ignorance of his presence, or from a desire to
ignore it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the 9th inst., the Earl of Newcastle sent letters
to the Earl of Leven and Lord Fairfax for a parley,
not taking notice of the Earl of Manchester being there,
but in that respect the treaty was refused and notice
sent to Newcastle that unless he directed his letters to
all three generals he could have no answer, whereupon
letters were sent to all three Generals, and a civil
excuse by the omission in regard, as he pretended, he
did not know the Earl of Manchester in person had
been there.” It is possible the mistake may have
been intentional, with the object of again causing a
delay.</p>

<p>In June, Newcastle was reported to have had a success
of some sort, in which he was said to have lost
his life.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> Newcastle had been anxious to avoid a
junction with Rupert as long as possible, lest he
should lose some of the credit of defeating the enemy in
the North, he had no personal dislike of that General.
The two men were on good terms, and they were
correspondents. Among the Rupert letters are four
from Newcastle, congratulating him on different victories.
In one of them he says of those victories that,
“as they are too big for anybody else, so they appear
too small for his Royal Highness,” and in another
that, although Rupert will not allow them to be talked
about in his presence, they will be talked about “to
posterity, to His Royal Highness’s everlasting fame”.</p>

<p>Early on 1 July, Newcastle heard that Rupert with
his army would arrive that very day, and he immediately
wrote, and sent to Rupert, the following letter
of welcome:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“May it please your Highness, you are welcome,
sir, so many several ways, as it is beyond my arithmetic
to number, but this I know, you are the Redeemer
of the North, and the Saviour of the Crown.
Your name, sir, hath terrified three great Generals,
and they fly before it. It seems their design is not
to meet your Highness, for I believe they have got
a river between you and them; but they are so nearly
gone as there is (no) certainty at all of them or their
intentions, neither can I resolve anything, since I am
made of nothing but thankfulness and obedience to
your Highness’s commands.”</p>

<p>Rupert arrived, as Warwick tells us, “with a very
good army, Goring being joined to him with the
Northern horse”. It was not without some skilful
man&oelig;uvring that he was able to effect an entrance
into York. Here is his enemy’s account of it:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="tdr">“<span class="smcap">Leaguer before York.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Earls of Leven, Lindsay, and Manchester,
Ferdinando Lord Fairfax, and Thos.
Hatcher.</span> Since our last the conditions of affairs
is not a little changed for on Monday last, upon
notice of Prince Rupert’s march from Knaisburgh
(Knaresborough) towards us, we resolved and accordingly
drew out the armies to have met him.”
They do not say that Newcastle came after them, but
Heath (<cite>Chronicle</cite>, p. 58) says, “those in York pursued
their rear, and seized some provisions,” which
must have been most welcome to a half-famished garrison
expecting a good many thousand more hungry
men who would also want food. The Generals go on
to say that they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>“for that end did march the same
night to Long Marston, about four miles west of York,
but the Prince having notice thereof passed with his
army at Boroughbridge,” a place about eighteen miles
to the north-west of York, and quite out of his
direct route, “and so put the river Ouse betwixt him
and us, whereby we were disabled to oppose his passage
into York, the bridge we built on the west side
of the town, being so weak that we durst not adventure
to transport our armies over upon it. This made
us resolve the next morning to march to Tadcaster
for stopping his passage southward.”</p></div>

<p>According to this account, therefore, it was Rupert
who put the river between himself and the enemy,
and not the enemy who put the river between themselves
and Rupert, as Newcastle had written.</p>

<p>Rupert having effected his juncture with Newcastle,
the Parliamentary generals had to consider what
should be their next step. It used to be held that
a besieging army should be larger than that of
the place invested; but the Royalist and the Parliamentary
armies were pretty equal in numbers. The
most probable decision of the Parliamentary Generals,
therefore, would be to retire.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was a question whether
it would be the policy of the Royalist army to force
an engagement. With a fortified town at their
backs, it might have been under other circumstances;
but Newcastle’s men had been much underfed of late,
and Rupert’s were wearied by long marches, whereas
the Parliamentary forces, although very short of provisions,
were better fed than Newcastle’s, nor were
they travel-worn like Rupert’s.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>When Rupert went into York, on Monday, 1 July,
he took about 2000 horse with him; but he left his
foot, his ordnance, and the remainder of his cavalry
in camp about five miles to the north of the town.</p>

<p>Newcastle, a dignified man of middle-age, accustomed
to respect and deference, had now to receive as
his superior officer that impetuous sprig of royalty,
Prince Rupert, a youth of 22; and, glad as he was that
Rupert had come to his relief, he can scarcely have
got rid of all his previous feelings of jealousy. He
told Rupert that the enemy had already raised the
siege, that the Parliamentary Generals were quarrelling,
that there was intense jealousy between the
Scotch and the English troops, and that, in all probability,
the army from Scotland would separate itself
from its English allies, when, if left to themselves, the
enemy would disperse in various directions, and would
make no further attempts upon York.</p>

<p>Rupert, on the contrary, wanted to attack, stating
that he had a letter in his pocket from the King
commanding him to give battle to the Parliamentary
army and crush it, once for all.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Newcastle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>urged that it would at least be wiser to await the
arrival of Colonel Clavering, whom he was momentarily
expecting with more than 3000 men, as well
as that of 2000 men from the Northern garrisons.
With this addition of 5000 men, the Royalist army
would have considerably outnumbered that of the
Parliament. Besides the reinforcements definitely expected,
Newcastle had great hopes of the arrival of
Montrose with some troops from Scotland. Rupert
replied to Newcastle’s arguments by saying: “Nothing
venture, nothing win,” and then he returned to
his camp and spent the night there.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_101_101" id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> Sir Philip Warwick (p. 278), who was present at the battle
which followed, wrote: “Had not the Lord Digby, this year, given
a fatal direction to that excellent Prince Rupert to fight the Scottish
Army, surely that great Prince and soldier had never so precipitately
fought them”.
</p>
<p>
Digby was supposed to have inspired the King to write the
letter to Rupert here mentioned. The letter said: “If York be
lost, I shall esteem my crown little less.... But if York be relieved,
and you beat the rebels of both Kingdoms which are before it, then,
but not otherwise, I may possibly make a shift.” Lord Culpepper,
when the King told him that this letter had been sent, exclaimed:
“Why, then, before God you are undone; for upon this peremptory
order he will fight, whatever comes of it” (Warburton’s <em>Prince
Rupert</em>, vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, p. 438).</p></div>

<p>Early on the Tuesday morning Rupert was again
in York and with Newcastle. Meanwhile there had
been as much diversity of opinion between the Parliamentary
Generals on the question of fighting or
not fighting, as between the Royalist. The English
Generals were all for action, the Scotch for a withdrawal
to seek some more favourable battle-field, and
finally the latter over-persuaded the former.</p>

<p>In the Royalist council of war, Rupert was able to
reply to Newcastle’s continued desire for delay until
the arrival of the shortly expected reinforcements, by
stating that his scouts reported the enemy to be already
on the move and that, unless they were attacked that
day, they would probably altogether escape a battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Newcastle persisted in his objections to an immediate
engagement, while Rupert’s persistence in favour of
it never wavered. Heated, if courteous, words are
said to have passed between the two Generals&mdash;the
story that they even came to blows may be safely
dismissed as fiction&mdash;but finally Newcastle yielded
although under strong protest, to the royal authority,
saying: “I am ready and willing, on my part, to obey
Your Highness, no otherwise than if His Majesty
were here in person. Happen what may, I will not
shun to fight: for I have no other ambition than to
live and die a loyal subject of His Majesty.”</p>

<p>Rupert replied: “My Lord, I hope we shall have a
glorious day”.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Orders were then given to marshal
all the forces into order of battle.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_102_102" id="Footnote_102_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_102_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> Such is the substance of the story as told by several contemporary
writers. Clarendon, however, in his very brief account of
the Battle of Marston Moor, says: “The Prince, without consulting
with the Marquis of Newcastle, or any of the officers within
the town, sent for all the soldiers to draw out, and put the whole
army in battalia”. But Cholmley’s Memorials touching the Battle
of York, which were drawn up for Clarendon’s information, and on
which Clarendon most likely based his own account, were written
in 1649, five years after the event, when Cholmondley may have
forgotten some of the details.</p></div>

<p>The rear-guard of the Parliamentary army was just
preparing to start&mdash;the advance-guard was already
three miles on its road towards Tadcaster, when a body
of Royalist horse appeared, pulled up, and then galloped
away. Almost immediately afterwards, between ten
and eleven o’clock, 5000 of Rupert’s horse entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>upon the moor, near Marston village, where the rebel
army had been encamped during the night and a small
part of it was still remaining. On hearing of this the
Parliamentary Generals thought that Rupert was
man&oelig;uvring to attack them on their march. If he
fell upon their rear it might be fatal, therefore Fairfax
sent gallopers on the fastest horses he could find to
urge the immediate return of all the Parliamentary
troops then on the march.</p>

<p>Marston Moor lies seven miles to the west of York,
about half-way between that city and Knaresborough.
Although enclosed in 1767, at the time with which
we are dealing much of it consisted of a large tract
of open moorland, covered with whinbushes and
gorse; but there were fields of rye on the southern
side. The soil was marshy in some places and sandy
in others. A road called Marston Lane crossed it,
for about two miles from east to west, and 300 or
400 yards to the north of this lane ran “a great
ditch,” almost parallel with it. This ditch separated
the moor from some cultivated land.</p>

<p>On the south side, for the most part in some fields
of rye, between the road and the ditch, the Parliamentary
Generals placed the main body of their troops as
they arrived. To the north of the ditch, the part
of the moor on which the Royalist troops were gradually
assembling, the ground was very flat; but from
the road, running from east to west, the ground
rises towards the south; and, upon this rising ground,
the General of the Scotch ordnance placed twenty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>five
guns. Behind these guns, and still higher on the
incline, the Generals of the Parliamentary army made
their head-quarters, near which they posted their
wagons and stores.</p>

<p>The arrival and the posting of the troops seems to
have been slow on both sides. To distinguish between
the two armies, the Cavaliers wore no scarves,
and the Puritans wore white paper or white handkerchiefs
in their hats; their watchword was “God with
us,” while that of the Cavaliers was “God and the
King”. “How goodly a sight,” wrote Ash, Lord Manchester’s
chaplain, “was this to behold, when two
mighty armies, each of which consisted of above 20,000
horse and foot, did, with flying colours prepared for
the battle, look each other in the face.”</p>

<p>But afternoon had come on and many of Newcastle’s
troops had not yet arrived. More extraordinary
still, Newcastle himself had not put in an appearance.
Rupert galloped back to York to find out the
reason of the delay. There he found that a considerable
number of Newcastle’s cavalry were in a state of
mutiny, clamouring for their long over-due pay, and
openly declaring that they would not leave the city to
face the enemy until they got it. Both Rupert and
Newcastle “played the orator” to them; but it was
only after oft-repeated promises of prompt payment
that they yielded and marched out of York so late as
nearly five o’clock in the afternoon, with Rupert riding
in the rear, and Newcastle, in his state-coach drawn by
six horses, following them at a short distance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>Having once started, the hitherto reluctant cavalry
rode rapidly to the front. Rupert had arranged everything
for his order of battle before going into York.
The accounts of that order are rather conflicting; but,
roughly speaking, it was something of this sort. The
centre was composed mainly of infantry under Newcastle
and King, or Lord Ethyn as he was now
entitled. The right wing was formed of Rupert’s
own cavalry, including his regiment of “old soldiers
all, gentlemen who had seen much service in France
and Spain,” Lord Byron’s Irish horse, Lord Grandison’s
horse, and some other cavalry, in all 7200 horse,
drawn up in twelve divisions. The left wing contained
about 4000 of Newcastle’s cavalry under Goring
and Sir Charles Lucas, with a line of musketeers in
front of them. The whole of the ditch was also lined
with musketeers. A few guns were also posted in the
ditch, and the rest of the artillery was placed on the
flanks.</p>

<p>Confronting the Royalist centre was the Parliamentary
infantry under Manchester and Leven. Opposite
the Royalist right, the enemy’s left contained
Cromwell’s “Ironsides,” other cavalry of Manchester’s
and some Scottish horse; in all about 4200 horse,
supported by 3000 foot soldiers. In front of the
Royalist left the enemy’s right was made up of 4800
horse, consisting of Lord Fairfax’s famous cavalry and
some Scottish cavalry regiments, including the Ayrshire
Lancers&mdash;rather an uncommon armament at that
period. In both armies reserves of cavalry and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>fantry
were drawn up in the rear. The numbers in
the opposing armies is doubtful; but probably they
were pretty equal, and something over 20,000 on either
side.</p>

<p>Rupert showed Ethyn a sketch of his position and
asked him how he liked it. Ethyn replied that it was
very fine on paper, but that it would not be so on the
field. Rupert had placed his front rank close to the
ditch, which was impassable in many places, and to this
Ethyn strongly objected. Rupert replied, “They may
be drawn to a farther distance”. Ethyn, probably
thinking that any retreat along the whole line would
draw on an immediate attack from the enemy, replied,
“No, sir. It is too late.”</p>

<p>Rupert was very angry with Ethyn for saying this.
They had not been on the best of terms beforehand,
for Rupert thought that Ethyn, when General King,
had not sufficiently supported him in a certain battle
on the Continent. Rupert revenged himself upon
Ethyn for finding fault with his order of battle on
Marston Moor by twitting him when the engagement
was over, for having been of very little use during the
action.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, a few shots were
fired from the cannon of both armies; but without important
results, although a captain was killed on each
side; on one a nephew of Cromwell, on the other a son
of Sir Gilbert Haughton. Some of the Puritan soldiers
sang psalms, deriving considerable consolation from
the psalmist’s denunciations of his enemies, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>they mentally applied to what they called “the King’s
cursed and cursing cormorants”. Rupert, not tolerating
defeat even in devotion, ordered his chaplain to
preach to his men; on hearing of which the Puritans
declared Rupert to be a “jingling Machiavelian,”
guilty of a blasphemous mockery.</p>

<p>Several showers had fallen during the day, and
towards evening black clouds gathered overhead, a
heavy thunderstorm set in, and rain fell in torrents.
On arriving at Marston Moor, Newcastle asked
Rupert whether he meant to fight that evening&mdash;it
was then between five and six o’clock. Rupert said
that he had no intention of doing so and that he
would make his grand attack early in the morning:
at the same time he recommended Newcastle to seize
the opportunity of taking a rest.</p>

<p>A rest was only too welcome! Newcastle had had
a long, anxious, perplexing day, and he was glad to
return to his coach, which had been left at some little
distance behind the troops. The first thing he did on
getting into it was to light his pipe<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and enjoy a
soothing smoke, after which, utterly worn out by
worry, he fell asleep upon the cushions of his chariot.</p>

also mentions the pipe incident (<cite>Clarendon State Papers</cite>, No. 1805),
but he gives a rather different account of it. This opportunity
may be taken of saying that the accounts of the Battle of Marston
Moor are so conflicting, that, for once, the scribe has departed
from his usual custom of making his witnesses speak for themselves,
and has attempted to give the substance of the story as
best as he can, after studying the various, and very varying,
authorities on the subject.</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Many</span> people may have experienced the sensation
of being suddenly disturbed soon after going to sleep,
when very tired. Sleep at that time is supposed to
be at its deepest. On being awakened, although only
ten or twenty minutes may have actually passed since
sleep came on, it would seem as if it had lasted for
hours; not that there is the sense of refreshment usual
after long sleep, on the contrary, the feeling left is
one of bewilderment combined with extreme languor.</p>

<p>It is probable that with some such sensations Newcastle
suddenly awoke, about seven o’clock, on the
evening of Tuesday, 2 July, 1644; and there was
noise in abundance to disturb his slumbers. The
heavy roll of the thunder was drowned by the booming
of cannon, the firing of muskets, pistols and arquebuses,
and the war cries of the excited soldiers; for
in those primitive times soldiers fought near enough
to bandy curses with each other. One naturally
wonders whether, when it came to “push of pike,” the
Roundhead warriors remembered how strictly they
had been forbidden by Cromwell to use bad language,
if indeed any language could be worse than that of
the Puritan divines themselves.</p>

<p>Most likely the Generals on either side had had no
intention of fighting that evening; certainly there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>no reason for doubting the sincerity of Rupert in
telling Newcastle that he did not intend to attack until
the morning; but, as we have seen, the rival armies
had been drawn up perilously close to each other.
They were within musket-shot&mdash;a very short distance
with the fire-arms of the period, and it may be that
the battle was begun by some of the men without
orders from their officers. Anyhow, the match had
been applied to the powder; probably the Generals
on either side thought that the battle had been begun
by those on the other, and soon orders were given in
all directions for a general engagement.</p>

<p>Newcastle armed himself as quickly as possible,
mounted his horse and galloped to the front, accompanied
by his brother, Sir Charles Cavendish, two
other officers, and his page. The first men he came
upon were some gentleman volunteers, who had formerly
chosen him for their captain, and he called out
to them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, You have done me the Honour to
choose me your Captain, and now is the fittest time
that I may do you service; wherefore if you’ll follow
me I shall lead you on the best I can, and show
you the way to your own Honour”.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>They were soon under fire and Newcastle led them
against a regiment of Scottish infantry. By some ill-luck,
or clumsiness, he lost his sword; but, although
several officers immediately offered him theirs, he
refused them and took his page’s little sword, which
the Duchess tells us was “half leaden”. With this
little weapon, however, he killed three Scots and led
his company of volunteers right through the enemy’s
regiment. Then he was brought to a standstill by
a single brave Puritan pikeman, whom he charged
three times without effect, but the courageous fellow
was hacked down by the followers of Newcastle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Newcastle’s cavalry were doing splendidly
on his left under Goring and Sir Charles Lucas,
whose sister Newcastle subsequently married. She
describes her brother as one who by nature “had a
practick genius to the warlike arts, or Arts in War,
as Natural Poets have to Poetry”. With regard to
the Royalist cavalry, Mr. Fortescue, in his standard
work, <cite>A History of the British Army</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> writes
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>“the superiority of the Royalist cavalry. The
long neglect of the mounted service left the supremacy
to the ablest amateurs, and the majority of
these, though there were hundreds of gentlemen
on the Parliamentary side, were undoubtedly for the
King. Nor was it only the courage, honour, and
resolution of which Cromwell had spoken that favoured
them; they had from the nature of the case
better horses, a higher standard of horsemanship and
equipment, a quicker natural intelligence and a higher
natural training. The thousand lessons which the
county gentlemen learned when riding with hawk
and hound were of infinite advantage in the casual
and irregular warfare of the first two or three years
... One fatal defect however marred what should
have been a most efficient cavalry, the blot had been
hit by Cromwell, indiscipline.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> Vol. <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, pp. 201-2.</p></div>

<p>It was with such cavalry as this that Goring and
Sir Charles Cavendish charged on Marston Moor, on
a day which, Mr. Fortescue says, “may indeed be
termed the first great day of English cavalry”.</p>

<p>On the whole, Ethyn may have been right in
blaming Rupert for drawing up his army close to the
“great ditch,” but his having done so did him good
service on his left flank; for, when Fairfax wished to
charge Newcastle’s cavalry, he found the ditch impassable,
and his only means of reaching his enemy to be
an almost straight lane which ran at right angles to,
and across, the ditch. Fairfax’s cavalry were only
able to cross the bridge over the ditch “three or
four” abreast, and it is surprising that they should
have got over it at all, exposed as they were to the
fire of musketeers lining the lane. The muskets of
the period, however, could be reloaded but very
slowly, and the heavy rain which was falling may
have interfered with the priming and caused missfires.
Nor did the Royalist artillery, likewise directed upon
the bridge, but also probably hampered by the rain,
very seriously cripple the invaders. Fairfax’s horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>drove the Royalist gunners “from their cannon, being
two drakes” (six-pounders) and a “demiculverine” (a
nine-pounder).</p>

<p>What appears to have obstructed the progress of
Fairfax’s cavalry even more than the musketeers,
the drakes and the demiculverine, was a quantity of
furze bushes and small ditches which they found
lying between themselves and Newcastle’s horse,
when they had got over the “great ditch”. The
Royalist cavalry was also inconvenienced by these
impediments, for both sides charged simultaneously.
“We were a long time engaged with one another,”
wrote Fairfax, who was unhorsed and received a deep
cut across the cheek which marked him for the rest of
his life. Sir Charles Fairfax and Major Fairfax were
killed. “There was scarce an officer but received a
hurt,” wrote Lord Fairfax. Sir William Fairfax led
the Yorkshire foot across the ditch over Moor Lane
Bridge; but the fire of Newcastle’s famous regiment
of Whitecoats did this infantry more mischief than
it had done to the cavalry; and the Yorkshire foot
were driven back, thinned in numbers and completely
demoralized by the gallant Royalists.</p>

<p>A small portion of Newcastle’s horse ran away and
Fairfax, with about 400 men, made the mistake of
following them for some distance towards York. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>it occurred to him that he had better return to see
how the rest of his cavalry was faring; so he galloped
back.</p>

<p>He says:<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> “Having charged through the enemy,
my men going after in pursuit, and myself returning
back to my other troops, I was got-in among the enemy
who stood, up and down the field, in several bodies of
horse. So, taking the signal out of my hat, I passed
through them for one of their own commanders, and
got to my Lord of Manchester’s horse.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>During the temporary absence of Fairfax, the main
body of his cavalry had fallen into some confusion, and
Goring seized the opportunity of making a vigorous
charge upon it. The King’s old horse, “veterans of
hard service and fame,” were more than the newly
hired cavalry of the Roundheads could withstand and a
rout set in. Goring had a cry raised of “See they run
in the rear,” on hearing which those in the van turned
tail and began to run themselves. The Ayrshire
Lancers and the regiments of Lord Eglinton, whose
son was mortally wounded in this battle, held their
ground for some time; but the stampede of the routed
van at last bore them with it to the rear. Then there
was a general rush for the bridge over the ditch, which
some of the defeated foot had not yet crossed, and the
Parliamentary cavalry and infantry became hopelessly
mixed up, many men on foot being trampled upon by
the horses of their own comrades.</p>

<p>When the Roundhead troops had returned to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>own side of the ditch, the Royalist cavalry pursued
them headlong. Heath says, “the Scots some of them
ran ten miles on end, and a wee bit, crying quarter,
with other lamentable expressions of fear”. Arthur
Trevor in a letter to Ormonde, says that the Scottish
cavalry kept galloping away, crying “Wae’s us! Wae’s
us! We’re a’ undone.”</p>

<p>All, however, did not spur northward: some spurred
to Lincoln, some to Hull, some to Halifax, some to
Wakefield, all reporting the utter rout of the Parliamentary
army. The news reached Newark, whence
the Royalists sent an express messenger to convey
the glorious tidings to Oxford. Both at Oxford and
at Banbury, Church bells were rung, bonfires were
lighted, and fireworks were let off in honour of the
great victory of Rupert and Newcastle over the combined
armies of the Parliament and the Scotch. The
splendid news made happy the heart of King Charles
and set his anxious mind at rest.</p>

<p>Reports of the victory spread to London. Vicars,
the Puritan author, wrote: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>“Yea, our sottish and bewitched
mole-eyed malignants of London also, were

three armies, the death and imprisonment of all our
three most renowned and precious Generals”.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The defeated Roundhead Generals fled for their
lives. Manchester ran away, but repented and returned:
Lord Leven never drew rein till he reached
Leeds, twenty miles from the battle-field; and Lord
Fairfax fled for refuge to Cawood Castle, where, finding
neither food, fire nor candle, he philosophically got
into bed. Indeed Principal Baillee wrote in a letter
to a friend, dated 12 July, 1644: “All six generals
took to their heels&mdash;this to you alone”.</p>

<p>But let us return to the battle-field and observe a
few further details of the fight: for thus far we have
only been concerned with the Royalist left wing
and the Parliamentary right.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the battle, soon after seven
in the evening, the left wing of the Roundheads
charged the ditch, which was passable in their front.
While Manchester’s infantry attacked that of Newcastle,
Cromwell’s cavalry charged Rupert’s, Byron’s
and the Irish horse. “And now,” wrote Manchester’s
chaplain, “you might have seen the bravest
sight in the world, for they moved down the hill like
so many thick clouds, in brigades of 800, 1,000, 1,200
and 1,500 each.” “We came down the hill,” says
Watson, who was with Cromwell’s cavalry, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>“in
bravest order and with the greatest resolution that
ever was seen.... In a moment we were passed the
ditch and on to the moor upon equal terms with the
enemy.” The Royalists abandoned four drakes in
the ditch. Watson continues: “Our front division
charged their front, Cromwell’s division of 300 horse,
in which he himself was in person, charging the first
division of Prince Rupert’s, of which himself was in
person,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in which all were gallant men”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_108_108" id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> Some accounts, however, state that, instead of leading his
own men, Rupert led Newcastle’s horse on the Royalist left.</p></div>

<p>Yet it was not all plain sailing for Cromwell and
his cavalry. A sword-wound<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> on the neck obliged
Cromwell to leave the field and receive surgical treatment
in a house hard by, and the Royalist cavalry
made a splendid resistance, repelling the Roundheads
several times. As was the custom in those days, both
sides galloped towards each other until they were
within shot, when they pulled up and fired their carbines
or pistols, and then charged with their swords.
It is said that at the last charge on this occasion, the
rival cavalry, after firing, threw their pistols at each
others heads.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_109_109" id="Footnote_109_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> Mark Trevor, who is said to have given the wound, was
created Lord Dungannon, for his services in this war. But Whitelock
says that the wound was made by a graze from a pistol bullet,
“which some imagined to be by accident and want of care by
some of his own men”. General Crawford supports this account
of the wound. See Masères’s <cite>Tracts</cite>. The story of the sword-wound
is in Leadman’s <cite>Battles Fought in Yorkshire</cite>, p. 138; a
book giving a very elaborate account of the battle.</p></div>

<p>Carlyle describes the scene as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>“the most enormous
hurly-burly of fire and smoke and steel flashings and
death tumult, ever seen in those regions. We just
get a glimpse of them joining battle in complete array
and the next shows them scattered, broken, straggling
across moor and field on both sides in utter bewilderment.”
A spirited account, but somewhat misleading,
for they fought long and hard before either side was
scattered.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Royalists, among Rupert’s
horse were some raw levies, and although his own
old troops were the bravest and most brilliant cavalry
then in this country, they were lacking in that virtue
in which Cromwell’s “Ironsides” excelled, namely
discipline; and discipline now told its tale. This
cavalry contest is said to have lasted an hour. Before
the end of it Cromwell had returned to the field. The
issue still seemed doubtful, when Sir David Leslie’s
horse came up and attacked the Royalists in the flank,
which at last wavered, broke and fled, “Cromwell
scattering them before him like a little dust,” says
Watson with bombastic exaggeration. Anyhow, in
the end, the cavalry on the right wing of the Royalist
army was thoroughly routed.</p>

<p>On the Royalist left Goring, after defeating the
enemy’s cavalry, had followed the usual custom of
attacking the flank of the enemy’s infantry with his
victorious horse; but he could rally only a few troops
for this purpose. The greater part of Newcastle’s
cavalry had galloped far out of sight in pursuit of
the vanquished Scottish fugitives. Another part had
cantered up the hill and was busily engaged in looting
the Parliament’s wagons and stores.</p>

<p>But another General was adopting the same tactics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>on an opposite side of the field with much greater
success. Cromwell, having routed the Royalist cavalry
with his own, had nearly the whole of his well-disciplined
horse in hand, wherewith to attack the
right flank of the Royalist infantry, and that attack
Newcastle’s infantry were unable to resist. They
were soon in confusion, regiment after regiment was
charged and dispersed, and the King’s infantry became
a rabble of scattered fugitives.</p>

<p>But not all! And now we come to the most
heroic incident in the whole battle, an incident
which did great and lasting honour to the army of
Newcastle. It is thus described in a book which
was published only thirty-two years after it took
place.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“There was yet standing two regiments of the Lord
Newcastle’s, one called by the name of his Lambs [or
Whitecoats]: these being veteran soldiers, and accustomed
to fight, stood their ground, and the fury of
that impression of Cromwell, which routed the whole
army besides; nor did the danger nor the slaughter
round them make them cast away their arms or their
courage; but seeing themselves destitute of their
friends, and surrounded by their enemies, they cast
themselves into a ring, where though quarter was
offered them, they gallantly refused it, and so manfully
behaved themselves, that they slew more of the
enemy in this particular fight, than they had killed of
them before. At last they were cut down, not by the
sword, but showers of bullets, after a long and stout
resistance, leaving their enemies a sorrowful victory,
both in respect of themselves whom they would have
spared, as in regard of the loss of the bravest men on
their own side, who fell in assaulting them. A very
inconsiderable number of them were preserved, to be
the living monuments of that Brigade’s loyalty and
valour.”</p>

<p>William Lilly says, in his Diary, that the Whitecoats,
“by mere valour, for one whole hour kept the
troops of horse from entering amongst them at near
push of pike: when the horse did enter they would
have no quarter, but fought it out until there was not
thirty of them living. Those whose hap it was to be
beaten down upon the ground as the troopers came
near them, though they could not rise for their wounds,
yet were so desperate as to get either a pike or a
sword, or piece of them, and to gore the troopers’
horses, as they came over them or passed by them.
Captain Coventry, then a trooper under Cromwell, and
an actor,”&mdash;it is curious that there should have been
a “play-actor” among the troops of Cromwell&mdash;“who
was the third or fourth man that entered amongst
them, protested he never, in all the fights he was in,
met with such resolute brave fellows, or whom he
pitied so much, and said he saved two or three
against their wills.”</p>

<p>Heath says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>“Night ended the pursuit: for it was
eleven o’clock before the fight ceased, else more blood
had been shed.... Here were slain to the number
of 8,000 and upwards in the field and flight; which at
certain was divided equally between both armies: for
what slaughter was made by the prince upon the
Scots and Fairfax, was requited by Cromwell on the
left wing as aforesaid, and the fight was furious and
bloody there. It must needs be a great carnage;”
and then some horrible details follow.</p>

<p>Newcastle remained on the field to the end. The
Duchess says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His two sons had Commands, but His Brother,
though he had no Command, by reason of the weakness
of his body; yet he was never from My Lord
when he was in action, even to the last; for he was
the last with my Lord in the Field in that fatal Battel
upon <em>Hessom-moor</em>,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> near York; and though my
Brother, Sir Charles Lucas, desired My Lord to send
his sons away, when the said battel was fought, yet
he would not, saying, His sons should shew their
Loyalty and Duty to His Majesty, in venturing their
lives, as well as Himself”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> Marston Moor was sometimes called Hessom Moor.</p></div>

<p>The three Generals of the Roundhead army state
in their official dispatch that the Royalists lost “all
their ordnance to the number of 20 (pieces), their ammunition,
baggage, about 100 colours and 10,000
arms”. Whitelock says (89): “From this battle and
the pursuit, some reckon were buried 7,000 Englishmen,
all agree that above 3,000 of the Prince’s men
were slain in the battle, besides those in the chace and
3,000 prisoners taken, etc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>To the “chace,” as Whitelock calls it, an end was put
by darkness. Rupert escaped being taken prisoner
by dismounting and hiding in a field of standing beans.
Afterwards he succeeded in getting into York, as also
did Newcastle. Just outside the town Newcastle met
Rupert, to whom he exclaimed: “All is lost!” As
well he might. Marston Moor was a defeat from
which the Royalist cause never recovered, and it was
one of the greatest battles ever fought on English soil.</p>

<p>There was little disgrace in being overcome, after
an exceptionally hard-fought battle, by such a General
as Cromwell, to whom the honours of Marston Moor
are chiefly due. And Newcastle can scarcely be considered
a defeated General in this case, for Rupert was
in supreme command. His was the defeat. Newcastle
had been opposed to risking the engagement; yet,
finding himself in it, although against his will, he exhibited
exceptional courage as also did his men.</p>

<p>But Marston Moor saw the destruction, almost the
annihilation, of his army, the loss of his prestige, the
blasting of his hopes, the ruin of his fortunes.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">No</span>, I will not endure the laughter of the Court,”
said Newcastle,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> when, on the following morning,
Rupert asked him to make an effort to recruit his
forces. “I will go to Holland.”</p>

<p>“And I will rally my men!” said Rupert.</p>

<p>Before we blame Newcastle for deserting the King’s
service and leaving England without his permission,
we ought to remember that he was in a position
widely different from that of most defeated Generals.
He had been publicly proclaimed a traitor by the
Parliament. When any indemnity had been proposed
he had been specially excepted from it by name. If
he fell into the hands of the enemy, the Tower and
the block were almost inevitable; although, if he had
been taken prisoner in such a great battle as that of
Marston Moor, there is just a bare, but unlikely,
possibility that he might have been liberated in an
exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p>The most important evidence in his favour is a letter
from Charles <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, dated 28 November, 1644, that is about
four months after Newcastle had fled the country;
for, if the King excused his conduct, no one else had
a right to complain.</p>

<p>The Duchess says, that before leaving York
Newcastle had asked Rupert “to give this true and
just report of him to his Majesty, that he had
behaved himself like an honest man, a Gentleman,
and a Loyal subject. Which request the Prince
having granted, my Lord took his leave; and being
conducted by a Troop of Horse, and a Troop of
Dragoons to <em>Scarborough</em> went to Sea, and took
shipping for <em>Hamborough</em>; the Gentry of the Country,
who also came to take their leaves of My Lord,
being much troubled at his departure, and speaking
very honourably of him, as surely they had no reason
to the contrary.”</p>

<p>Quite true, in the main; but something said by Sir
Hugh Cholmley in his private memoirs<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> has a bearing
upon his last remark. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>“After the battle of Hess Moor,
the Marquis of Newcastle came to Scarborough, and
lodged at my house two days, till I had furnished
him with a ship to go beyond sea; at his departure,
he thanked me for my entertainment, and told me
‘he had some fear I should have stayed [stopped]
him’; which I suppose he conceived would be some
countenance to his: my answer was ‘I wish he
could stay; that if he had committed an error, I knew
my duty so well, I was not to call him to account,
but obey, he being my general; that for my own part,
though the place was in no defensible posture, I meant
not to surrender till I heard from the King, or was
forced to it’.” This was a broad hint to Newcastle
as to Cholmley’s opinion of his conduct in flying
from the country.</p>

Printed. 1870, p. 41.</p></div>

<p>In continuing her story, the Duchess says that
Newcastle, when “preparing for his journey, asked
his Steward How Much Money he had left? Who
answer’d, That he had but 90£. My Lord not being
at all startled at so small a Summ, although his
present design required much more, was resolved too
seek his Fortune, even with that little; ... he embarqued
with his Company, and arrived in four days
time to the said City, which was on the <em>8th of July,
1644</em>.”</p>

<p>Half a dozen lords, a bishop, and a good many
of his relations and friends, including his brother and
two sons, sailed with Newcastle.</p>

<p>“But before My Lord landed at <em>Hamborough</em>
his eldest Son <em>Charles</em>, Lord <em>Mansfield</em>, fell sick of
the Small Pox, and not long after his younger Son,
Henry, now Earl of <em>Ogle</em>, fell likewise dangerously ill
of the Measels; but it pleased God that they both
happily recovered.”</p>

<p>Here is some news of Newcastle after he had been
only a few days in Holland.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>“<span class="smcap">John Constable to his father, Sir Henry,

<p>Luckily for Newcastle, much of the blame which
was due to him was thrown upon Ethyn. Clarendon
says:<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> “The strange manner of the Prince’s coming,
and undeliberately throwing himself and all the King’s
hopes into that sudden and unnecessary engagement,
by which all the force the Marquis had raised, and
with so many difficulties preserved, was in a moment
cast away and destroyed, so transported him with
passion and despair that he could not think of beginning
the work again and involving himself in the same
undelightful condition of life, from which he might now
be free. He hoped his past meritorious actions might
outweigh his present abandoning the thought of future
actions and so, without farther consideration, he transported
himself out of the Kingdom, and took with him
General King” (Ethyn); “upon whom they who were
content to spare the Marquis, poured out all the reproaches
of infidelity, treason, and conjunction with
his country-men (the Scots),” an accusation which
Clarendon declares to have been “without the least
foundation”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>In the next paragraph Clarendon says that “the
loss of England,” which soon followed, made the loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of York comparatively little spoken of, and that Newcastle’s
patient endurance of his subsequent losses
“so perfectly reconciled all good men to him, that they
rather observed what he had done and suffered for the
King and for his country, without inquiring what he
had omitted to do”.</p>

<p>Henrietta Maria remained a steadfast friend to Newcastle,
even when he had fled from his country and
from her husband’s service. I “shall assure you,”
she wrote to him from Paris (20 Nov., 1644), “of
the continuance of my esteem for you, not being so
unjust as to forget past services upon a present misfortune.
And therefore believe that I shall always
continue to give proofs of what I tell you, and you
will see how I shall behave, and with what truth
I am, Your very good, and affectionate friend,</p>

<p>Of what happened to the remains of Newcastle’s
army at York, Heath tells us:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“The victor enemy being come again before York,
summoned the city again: they had used before
their utmost endeavours, by mines and assaults, (in
one whereof they lost nearly one thousand men, and
were beaten off) to have entered; to which the
Governor returned answer, that he was no whit
dismayed with their present success; yet nevertheless
on equal conditions he would come to a treaty and
surrender; which in nineteen days after the battle
was concluded on.” The garrison was allowed to
“march out according to the honourable custom of
war”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_119_119" id="Footnote_119_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> P. 61.</p></div>

<p>If there was still a sufficient garrison at York to
hold out for nineteen days&mdash;and there is nothing to
show that it could not have held out longer&mdash;was
Newcastle justified in deserting it? True, there was
no prospect of any adequate force coming to his relief;
and, in any terms of surrender, he, as a proclaimed
traitor, might not have been allowed to march out, a
free man, either with or without the honours of war.
On the other hand, if he had held York, what honour
would have been his in the case of the success of the
King’s army in the South and the total defeat of the
army of the Parliament, a contingency which, at that
time, was still apparently possible, and would have
been rendered more probable if a large portion of
the army of the Parliament had been occupied in the
siege of York.</p>

<p>To sympathisers with Newcastle, it may be consoling
to reflect that recriminations and reproaches
for neglect of duty or courage, at or after the battle
of Marston Moor, were not confined to the Royalist
side, as both Rushworth and Clarendon bear witness.
Manchester and Cromwell disliked each other; and
another General, Crawford, a bitter enemy of Cromwell,
pretended that Cromwell, after receiving a very
slight wound in the neck given accidentally by one of
his own men, at the beginning of the battle of Marston
Moor, had made it an excuse to escape from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>field until the fighting was practically over.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Cromwell
seized opportunities of bringing counter-charges against
both Crawford and Manchester, accusing the latter of
disaffection to the Parliamentary cause.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_120_120" id="Footnote_120_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> “Lieutenant-General Cromwell had the impudence and boldness
to assume much of the honour of that victory to himself....
My friend Cromwell had neither part nor lot in the business. For
I have several times heard it from Crawford,” [Crawford was
Major-General to the Earl of Manchester’s Brigade] “that, when
the whole army at Marston Moor was in a fair possibility to be
utterly routed, and a great part of it was still running, he saw the
body of horse of that brigade standing still, and to his seeming
doubtful which way to charge, backward or forward, when he came
up to them in a great passion, reviling them with the names of
poltroons and cowards, and asked them if they would stand still
and see the day lost? Whereupon Cromwell showed himself, and
said in a pitiful voice: ‘Major-General, what shall I do?’ Crawford
replied: ‘Sir, if you charge not, all is lost’. Cromwell
answered that he was wounded and was not able to charge (his
great wound being a little burn in the neck by the accidental going-off
behind him of one of the soldier’s pistols), then Crawford
desired him to go off the field, and sending one away with him ...
led them on himself, which was not the duty of his place and as
little for Cromwell’s honour.”&mdash;<cite>Memoirs of Denzil Lord Hollis.</cite></p></div>

<p>Welbeck, Newcastle’s home, received a visit from
the enemy, about a month after its owner had sailed
from England. The guest shall tell his own story:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Edward Earl of Manchester to the Committee
of both Kingdoms.</span> ... Upon my coming near Welbeck,
I sent a summons to the place and they with
great civility sent to parley with me. The next day,
Friday, they rendered the house to me upon composition.
I was willing to give them large terms, because
I was not in a condition to besiege a place so well
fortified as that was. I therefore gave the officers
and soldiers liberty to march out with all their arms
and colours flying; but when I came to take possession
of the house most of the soldiers came to me to
lay down their arms, desiring tickets of me to return
to their own homes, the which I granted them, so as
I had 350 muskets in the house, 50 horse arms, 11
pieces of cannon great and small, whereof the Governor
had liberty to carry away one: I had likewise 20
barrels of powder and a ton of match. The house I
preserved entire, and put a garrison into it of Notts
men, until I know your Lordship’s resolutions whether
you will have it slighted or no. The place is very
regularly fortified; and the Marquis of Newcastle’s
daughters and the rest of his children and family are
in it, unto whom I have engaged myself for their quiet
abode there, and to intercede to the Parliament for a
complete maintenance for them; in the which I beseech
your Lordships that they may have your favour
and furtherance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Manchester seems not only to have “engaged” himself
for the quiet abode of Newcastle’s children in the
home at Welbeck, but eventually to have left it ungarrisoned
by Parliamentary troops; for, some thirteen
months later, Welbeck entertained a very different
visitor, in the person of the King himself. Charles
went there under most depressing circumstances.
There was no banquet costing £5000 awaiting him
there now, nor a masque of welcome written by Ben
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>Jonson. The total defeat of his army in the North
at Marston Moor had recently been followed by as
complete a defeat by Cromwell of his army further
South at Naseby, when his baggage was captured
and his compromising letters to and from the Queen
and the Irish rebels were seized and published by the
Parliament. Newcastle’s late General, Goring, had
been defeated by Fairfax at Langport; and Rupert
had surrendered Bristol to the enemy. The last battle
fought in the open field on behalf of the King was
lost at Rowton, near Chester, on 23 September.</p>

<p>Charles’s only hope now lay in succour by Montrose,
whose only hope, again, lay in succour from the King.
Wandering from place to place, Charles, Clarendon
tells us,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> “had made haste from Ludlow, that the
Scottish army might no more be able to interrupt him;
and with very little rest, passed through Shropshire,
and Derbyshire, till he came to Welbeck, a house of
the Marquis of Newcastle in Nottinghamshire, then a
garrison for his Majesty; where he refreshed himself
and his troops, two days”. But what a contrast must
such gloomy refreshment have been to the magnificent
hospitality which he had received there on two former
occasions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>This was probably one of the saddest visits ever
paid to Welbeck. The Governor of Newark and the
Royalist gentry of Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and
Yorkshire waited upon the King during his short
visit at Newcastle’s home. At first it was decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>that Charles should proceed direct to Scotland and
join Montrose; but afterwards it was thought better
that he should take up his quarters at Doncaster and
raise troops in Yorkshire. However, it is no part of
our duty to follow the footsteps of that ill-fated King.</p>

<p>Here is a pathetic letter from Newcastle to the

<p>One of the first things that Newcastle had had to
do, on reaching Hamburg, was to raise money&mdash;no
easy task under the circumstances. He was so short
of cash that, as the Duchess tells us, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>“when his
occasions drew him abroad,” he was obliged to travel in
a wagon, “for want of a coach”. Having succeeded
in borrowing some money, a little later, he bought nine
horses for £160, and he also purchased a coach. Of
his subsequent proceedings, the Duchess has this to
tell us:&mdash;</p>

<p>“After my Lord had stay’d in <em>Hamborough</em> from
<em>July 1644</em>, till <em>February 16</em>, he being resolved to
go into <em>France</em> by Sea went from <em>Hamborough</em> to
<em>Amsterdam</em>, and from thence to <em>Rotterdam</em>, where he
sent one of his Servants with a Complement and tender
of his humble Service to Her Highness, the then Princess
Royal, the Queen of <em>Bohemia</em>, the Princess Dowager
of <em>Orange</em>, and the Prince of <em>Orange</em>, which was
received with much kindness and civility.”</p></div>

<p>After describing the rest of his journey, she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“My Lord being arrived at <em>Paris</em>, which was in
<em>April, 1645</em>, immediately went to tender his humble
duty to Her Majesty, the Queen-Mother of <em>England</em>,
where it was my Fortune to see him the first time,
I being then one of the Maids of Honour to Her
Majesty.”</p></div>

<p>Upon this seeing of Newcastle by one of the Maids
of Honour to Her Majesty a good deal depended, and
it will be best to deal with the matter in a fresh
chapter.</p>

Lucas, of whom she says: “though my father was
not a peer of the realm, yet there were few peers who
had much greater estates, or lived more noble therewith”.
She does not mention the fact that her great-grandfather
had been town-clerk of Colchester.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Her two brothers, Sir John, who was created Lord
Lucas by Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> in 1644, and Sir Charles, were
both distinguished cavaliers; and she mentions another
brother, Sir Thomas, of whom Burke&mdash;not the
Duchess&mdash;says he “was illegitimate, having been
born prior to the marriage of his parents”. For this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>trifling confusion of dates, the excellent Lady Lucas
endeavoured to atone by the prudishness upon which
she insisted in her children. The Duchess tells us
that&mdash;</p>

<p>“She was of a grave Behaviour, and had such a
Majestic Grandeur, as it were continually hung about
her, that it would strike a kind of an awe to the beholders,
and command respect from the rudest....
She had a well favoured loveliness in her face, a
pleasing sweetness in her countenance, and a well-temper’d
complexion, as neither too red nor too
pale.... Also she was an affectionate Mother,
breeding her children with a most industrious care,
and tender love, and having eight children, three sons
and five daughters, there was not any one crooked, or
any ways deformed, neither were they dwarfish, or of
a Giant-like stature, but every ways proportionable;
likewise well featured, cleer complexions, brown haires,
but some lighter than others, sound teeth, sweet
breaths, plain speeches, tunable voices, I mean not so
much to sing as in speaking, as not stuttering, nor
wharling in the throat, or speaking through the nose,
or hoarsely, unless they had a cold, or squeakingly,
which impediments many have; neither were their
voices of too low a strain, or too high.” Negatively,
a truly remarkable family!</p>

<p>Of her father the Duchess says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>“He unfortunately
killed one Mr. Brooks in a single Duel; for my
father by the Laws of Honour could do no less than
call him to the field, to question him for an injury he
did him, where their Swords were to dispute, and one
or both of their lives to decide the argument, wherein
my Father had the better; and though my Father
by Honour challenged him, with Valour fought him,
and in Justice killed him, yet he suffered more than
any Person of Quality usually doth in cases of
Honour; for though the Laws be rigorous, yet the
present Princes most commonly are gratious in those
misfortunes, especially to the injured. But my
Father found it not, for his exile was from the
time of his misfortunes to Queen Elizabeth’s death;
for the Lord Cobham being then a great man with
Queen Elizabeth, and this Gentleman, Mr. Brooks,
a kind of a Favourite, and as I take it Brother to the
then L. Cobham, which made Queen Elizabeth so
severe, not to pardon him: but King James of blessed
memory graciously gave him his Pardon, and leave
to return home to his Native Country.”</p>

<p>The description of the education and family life of
herself and her sisters, given by the Duchess, is not
altogether uninteresting.</p>

<p>“As for tutors, although we had for all sorts of
vertues, as singing, dancing, playing on musick, reading,
writing, working, and the like, yet we were not
kept strictly thereto, they were rather for formality
than benefit, for my Mother cared not so much
for our dancing and fidling, singing and prating of
severall languages, as that we should be bred virtuously,
modestly, civilly, honourably, and on honest
principles.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>As to the habits of this edifying family, she
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“But to rehearse their Recreations. Their customs
were in Winter time to go sometimes to Plays, or to
ride in their Coaches about the Streets to see the
concourse and recourse of People; and in the Spring
time to visit the Spring garden, Hide park, and the
like places; and sometimes they would have Musick;
and sup in Barges upon the Water; these harmless
recreations they would pass their time away with;
for I observed, they did seldom make Visits, nor
never went abroad with Strangers in their Company,
but onely themselves in a Flock together agreeing so
well, that there seemed but one Minde amongst
them: And not onely my own Brothers and Sisters
agreed so, but my Brothers and Sisters in law, and
their Children, although but young, had the like
agreeable natures, and affectionable dispositions; for
to my best remembrance I do not know that ever
they did fall out, or had any angry or unkind disputes.
Likewise, I did observe, that my Sisters were so
far from mingling themselves with any other Company,
that they had no familiar conversation or
intimate acquaintance with the Families to which
each other were linkt to by Marriage, the Family
of the one being as great Strangers to the rest of
my brothers and Sisters, as the Family of the
other.”</p>

<p>How far such an education and such surroundings
would be conducive to breadth of mind, sociability,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>and success in the world, the reader must judge for
himself.</p>

<p>Although she had been exceedingly anxious to become
a Maid of Honour, Margaret does not appear
to have enjoyed the two years which she spent in that
capacity. She says: “I had heard that the world
was apt to lay aspersions even on the innocent, for
which I durst neither look up with my eyes, nor speak,
nor be any way sociable, insomuch as I was thought
a Natural Fool”. Being “fearfull and bashfull, I
neither heeded what was said or practic’d, but just
what belong’d to my loyal duty, and my own honest
reputation; and, indeed, I was so afraid to dishonour
my Friends and Family by my indiscreet actions, that
I rather chose to be accounted a Fool, then to be
thought rude or wanton; in truth, my bashfulness and
fears made me repent my going from home to see the
World abroad”.</p>

<p>Ballard says:<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> “Her person was very graceful, her
temper naturally reserved and shy, and she seldom
said much in company, especially among strangers”.
She herself confesses and deplores her own bashfulness;
but she declares it to be a better thing than
rudeness on the ground that “a rude nature is worse
than a brute nature, by so much more as man is better
than beast, but those that are of civil natures and gentle
dispositions, are as much nearer to celestiall creatures,
as those that are of rude or cruell are to Devils”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>This particular “celestiall creature” favours us with
some more details of her own character. “I am
gratefull, for I never received a curtesie but I am impatient,
and troubled untill I can return it; also I am
Chaste, both by Nature and Education, insomuch as I
do abhorre an unchast thought; likewise I am seldom
angry,” yet “when I am angry, I am very angry, but
yet it is soon over, and I am easily pacified, if it be
not such an injury as may create a hate”;&mdash;a highly
significant reservation&mdash;“neither am I apt to be exceptious
or jealous; but if I have the lest symptome
of this passion, I declare it to those it concerns, for I
never let it ly smothering in my breast to breed a
malignant disease in the minde.” “I am neither
spitefull, envious nor malicious; I repine not at
the gifts that Nature or Fortune bestows upon
others.” “My God,” she would almost seem to have
said, “I thank Thee that I am not as other women are.”</p>

<p>Newcastle had heard a good deal of Margaret
Lucas before he met her. He had been a friend and
a patron of her brother, whom Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> had made a
peer. Lord Lucas had been in Newcastle’s army,
and when Newcastle had asked him in what manner
he could best serve him, Lucas had replied that he
had no desires on his own account, being ready to
suffer exile or death in the royal cause; but that he
was anxious about his sister Margaret, at Queen
Henrietta’s little Court in Paris, as her beauty exposed
her to danger, and, owing to his losses through the
civil war, he had no dowry to bestow upon her. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>the same time he expatiated upon her character and
virtues to such an extent as to arouse the curiosity of
Newcastle.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>With the paragon of perfection self-described in the
preceding pages, the exiled Newcastle fell in love.
The lady herself shall describe what happened:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My Lord ... was pleased to take some particular
notice of me, and express more than an ordinary
affection for me; insomuch that he resolved to chuse
me for his Second Wife; for he, having but two Sons,
purposed to marry me, a young Woman that might
prove fruitful to him and encrease his Posterity by a
Masculine-Offspring. Nay, He was so desirous of
Male-Issue, that I have heard him say, He cared not
(so God would be pleased to give him many Sons)
although they came to be persons of the meanest
Fortunes; but God (it seems) had ordered it otherwise,
and frustrated his Designs”&mdash;here the Duchess
becomes very plain-spoken&mdash;“which yet did never
lessen his Love and Affection for me.”</p>

<p>Several of Margaret Lucas’s love-letters are in existence
at Welbeck Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Let us look at a few of
them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_128_128" id="Footnote_128_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128_128"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> Welbeck MSS.</p></div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Margaret Lucas to the Marquis of Newcastle.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“(1645, <span class="smcap">November.</span>) I fear others foresee we
shall be unfortunate though we see it not ourselves,
or else there would not be such pains taken to untie
the knot of our affection. I must confess that as you
have had good friends to counsel you, so I have had
good friends to counsel me and tell me they hear of
your professions of affection to me, which they bid me
take heed of, for you had assured yourself to many
and were constant to none. I said my Lord Newcastle
was too wise and too honest to engage himself
to many. I heard the Queen would take it ill I did
not make her acquainted before I had resolved.”</p></div>

<p>From this it is evident that Newcastle’s friends had
been trying to dissuade him from the marriage, and
that Margaret’s friends were also trying to prevent
it. It is not surprising that they should have done
so. Newcastle was then living entirely on credit
and was borrowing wherever he could. However
agreeable a man’s conversation may be, if it ends
in his saying, “By the way, I wonder whether you
would kindly lend me £ ... for a few days,” he is
not likely to be very popular.</p>

<p>As Margaret writes that the Queen would take it
ill unless informed before Margaret “resolved,” the
engagement was probably not yet definitely made.
In her next letter Margaret begins to fear that she
may have been immodestly forward in her flirtations
with Newcastle. Yet, under cover of ostentatious
bashfulness, she takes the opportunity of asking Newcastle
to propose his suit to the Queen.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Same to (the Same).</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“(1645, <span class="smcap">November.</span>) My Lord Widdrington in
his advice has done as a noble and true affectionate
friend would do.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
<p>“I do not send to you to-day, for if I do, they will
say I pursue you for your affections, for though I love
you extremely I never feared my modesty so small as
it would give me leave to court any man. If you
please to ask the Queen I think it would be well understood.
I thank you for the fear you have of my ruin.”
Let us hope that this was not written in the same spirit
in which people say: “I thank you for the fear you
have of my damnation”: but it has rather that look.</p></div>

<p>In another letter she says: “Saint Germains is a
place of much slander, and thinks I send too often to
you”. From the next letter it would seem that Newcastle
had been a little jealous of Porter; but no
courtship would be complete without a lover’s quarrel!</p>

<p>“I hope you are not angry for my advice about
Saint Germans. I gave it simply for the best. As
for Mr. Porter he was a stranger to me, for before I
came to France I never saw him or at least knew him
to be Mr. Porter or my Lord Newcastle’s friend. I
never speak to any man before they address themselves
to me nor look so much in their face as to invite
their discourse, and I hope I never was uncivil
to any person of whatsoever degree; but to-morrow the
Queen comes to Paris and then I hope to justify myself.”</p>

<p>In one letter she seems annoyed at hearing that
Newcastle had announced the engagement before it
was quite settled:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was said to me you had declared your marriage to
Lord Jermyn. I answered it was more than I could do.”</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter, Sir Philip Warwick told us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>that Newcastle “had the misfortune to have somewhat
of the poet in him”. This misfortune impelled
him to write poems to Margaret, who replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your verses are more like you than your picture,
though it resembles you very well”.</p>

<p>From a later letter, she would seem to have been
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germains and Newcastle in Paris, and that she
feared to go with the Queen to Paris lest she should
be supposed to be doing so with the object of flirting
with Newcastle:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hear the Queen comes to Paris next week to the
solemnities of Princess Mary’s marriage, and I am in
a dispute whether I should come with her if I can get
leave to stay. My reason is because I think it will stop
their discourse of us when they see I do not come. My
Lord let your eye limit your poetry.” Possibly Newcastle’s
verses may have begun to savour too strongly
of the Song of Solomon. The question of the poems
crops up again in a later letter, and they would seem to
have been the cause of a slight misunderstanding:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am sorry you should bid me keep the verses
you sent me, for it looks as though you thought I had
flung away those you sent before.”</p>

<p>But perhaps Newcastle may only have been anxious
that his verses should be carefully preserved, in order
that, at some future date, he might publish them in a
book of his “Collected Poems”. Poets are not totally
destitute of eyes to business. Anyhow, no maker of
verses would like to think that they had been “flung
away”. The next letter hints at more troubled waters:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>“I never said any such thing as you mentioned in
your letter about your picture, nor even showed it to
a creature before yesterday when I gave it to mend;
but I find such enemies that whatever is for my disadvantage,
though it have but a semblance of truth,
is declared.</p>

<p>“It is not usual to give the Queen gloves or anything
else, but if you please I will give them to her.”</p>

<p>Presently comes another letter which looks as if,
even then, all was not quite smooth between the lovers.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you have metamorphosed my letter and
made that masculine which was efemenat. My ambition
is to be thought a modest woman, and to leave
the title of a gallant man to you.”</p>

<p>Five affectionate letters follow, but they contain
nothing of world-wide interest. The last states Margaret’s
intention of going to Paris, and in a sixth
she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is nothing will please me more than to be
where you are, and I begin to admire Paris because
you are in it.”</p>

<p>Both Newcastle and Margaret were afraid of the
Queen, for in the next letter she says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know not what counsel to give concerning the
Queen, but I fear she will take it ill if she be not
made acquainted with our intentions. If you please
to write a letter to her and send it to me, I will deliver
it the day you send for me. I think it no policy
to displease the Queen, for though she will do us no
good she may do us harm. I send my maid about
some business, and she and Lady Brown”&mdash;the wife
of the English Ambassador&mdash;“shall agree about the
other thing you spoke of.</p>

<p>“Pray consider that I have enemies.”</p>

<p>From the following letter it would appear that the
Queen had been informed of the proposed marriage
and that she was very angry. Obviously Margaret
was expecting a wigging:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have not been with the Queen yet. I hear she
would have me acknowledge myself in a fault and she
not to be in any, but it will be hard for me to accuse
myself and to make myself guilty of a fault when I
am innocent, but if it be the duty of a servant to
obey all the commands of a mistress though it be
against myself I will do it, if it be but to bring myself
to the use of obedience against I am a wife. For
the hindrance of our marriage I hope it will not be
in their power. I am sure they cannot hinder me
from loving.”</p>

<p>From the next missive it is clear that there had been
an encounter between the Queen and Margaret and
that a truce had been patched up merely for appearance’
sake. It is also pretty evident that the Queen
would have stopped the marriage altogether if she
had had the power to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope the Queen and I are friends. She saith
she will seem so at least, but I find if it had been in
her power she would have crossed us. I heard not
of the letter, but she said to me that she had it in
writing that I prayed you not to make her acquainted
with our designs. My Lord since our affections are
published, it will not be for our honours to delay our
marriage. The Queen intends to come on Monday.
I will wait on her to Paris and then I am at
your service.”</p>

<p>In another letter she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hope the Queen and I shall be very good friends
again, and may be the better for the differences we
have had. It was reported here that you would be
with us before we could be with you, and be assured
I will bring none to our wedding but those you please.
I find to satisfy the opinion that we are not married
already we must be married by one of the priests here,
of which I think Cousens is the fittest. We shall not
come till Monday.”</p>

<p>The marriage received the approval of Margaret’s
mother; for she wrote:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">Elizabeth, Lady Lucas, to the Earl of

<p>Margaret thus analyses her love for Newcastle:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was the onely Person I ever was in love with;</p>

<p>Neither was I ashamed to own it, but gloried therein,
for it was not Amorous Love, I never was infected
therewith, it is a Disease, or a Passion, or both, I only
know by relation, not by experience; neither could
Title, Wealth, Power, or Person entice me to love;
but my love was honest and honourable, being placed
upon Merit, which Affection joy’d at the fame of his
Worth, pleas’d with delight in his Wit, proud of the
respects he used to me, and triumphing in the affections
he profest for me.”</p>

<p>This sounds rather an arctic sort of love; but, be
that as it may, the wedding took place, and, according
to Evelyn, in the chapel of Evelyn’s father-in-law,
Sir Richard Brown, the English Ambassador.</p>

<p>Although married to one who had been among the
wealthiest of English noblemen, the bride found herself
in poverty. Her husband was unable to obtain
a penny from England; the Parliament had taken
possession of his estates and he was living with money
borrowed upon, what looked at that time, exceptionally
bad security. The Duchess says that “the ordinary
Use” was then “at Six in the Hundred,” i.e. that
the usual interest on good securities was 6 per cent.
Then what rate of interest were lenders in Holland
and France likely to have charged an exile whose
chance of ever regaining his property seemed very
remote? The question summons up visions of something
nearer sixty than “six in the hundred”.</p>

<p>The bride thus describes the financial position:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“After My Lord was married, having no Estate or
Means left him to maintain himself and his Family,
he was necessitated to seek for Credit, and live upon
the Courtesie of those that were pleased to Trust him;
which although they did for somewhile, and shew’d
themselves very civil to My Lord, yet they grew
weary at length, insomuch that his Steward was forced
one time to tell him, That he was not able to provide
a Dinner for him, for his Creditors were resolved to
trust him no longer. My Lord being always a great
master of his Passions, was, at least shew’d himself
not in any manner troubled at it, but in a pleasant
humour told me, that I must of necessity pawn my
Cloaths to make so much Money as would procure a
Dinner. I answer’d That my Cloaths would be but
of small value and therefore desired my Waiting-Maid
to pawn some small toys, which I had formerly given
her, which she willingly did.”</p>

<p>One cannot help admiring Newcastle for being so
far “master of his Passions,” as to overcome any desire
to pawn his own clothes in order to get a dinner,
and for conceiving the happy idea of telling his wife
to pawn hers. When he had fortified himself by eating
the dinner provided by pawning the toys belonging
to his wife’s maid, Newcastle paid his creditors a
visit and, by “perswasive arguments,” induced them
to lend him some more money, with which he got the
toys out of pawn for his wife’s maid, and provided
her with means to go to England with the object
of endeavouring to obtain some money from his
brother-in-law.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Newcastle had “proffers made
him of rich matches in England for his two sons,”
whom he dispatched there forthwith, “hoping by that
means to provide for them <em>and himself</em>”&mdash;the italics
are not in the original. Somehow these matches failed
to come off; but at least one of his sons made a good
marriage a little later.</p>

<p>It may seem that, when Newcastle himself married
a girl who was not an heiress, he must have lost the
match-making instincts which he had inherited from
his grandmother; but in justice to his memory let it be
remembered that no heiresses were then to be had
at the impoverished Court of the English Queen in
France; and that, as Margaret’s father had been a
very wealthy man, in the case of a royal restoration it
was just possible that there might yet be some useful
pickings.</p>

was too quick”. An unpleasant expression; but Her
Majesty was quite right! For the King, unfortunately,
<em>did</em> seek “an assistance of the Scots,” with a
result only too well known.</p>

<p>The Queen did Newcastle a much greater service
than the empty compliment of an invitation to a Council
at which he was snubbed. She gave him £2000!
Fortunately at that time, she still had some money.
She received 12,000 crowns a month from Anne of
Austria, and she obtained help from some of her relations;
but she sent very large sums to her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>in England, and she made handsome donations to
distressed cavaliers&mdash;such as Newcastle&mdash;in France
and Belgium, selling her jewels for the same purposes.
When the wars of the Fronde began, those who were
helping her became in want themselves, and they could
do nothing more for her. She then found herself in
sore straits.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Montpensier says in her <cite>Memoirs</cite>:
“The Queen of England appeared, during a
little while, with the splendour of royal equipage, she
had a full number of ladies, of maids of honour, of running
footmen, coaches and guards. All vanished,
however, by little and little, and at last nothing could
be more mean than her train and appearance.” And so
things went on, from bad to worse, until, about three
years after the time with which we are now dealing,
Cardinal de Retz found her, with her last loaf eaten,
her last faggot burned, and her little daughter in bed
at mid-day, because there was no fire on the hearth
and snow was falling heavily.</p>

<p>Things were a long way from being so bad as that,
however, when she gave Newcastle £2000. Having
got that money, and having squeezed a little more
cash out of his creditors, instead of economising,
Newcastle left his lodgings and took a good house,
resolving, as his wife says, “for his own recreation and
divertisement in his banished condition, to exercise
the Art of Mannage, which he is a great lover and
Master of”. He gave £160 for one horse, and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>is now vulgarly termed an “I.O.U.” for £100, for
another. To estimate these prices as £480 and
£300 of our money would be to undervalue them.
But men in debt always seem to buy the longest-priced
horses.</p>

<p>Soon after he had made these purchases, the Queen
desired Newcastle to go to the Prince of Wales in
Holland; but his ungrateful creditors made a difficulty
about their debtor leaving Paris, whereupon the
Queen most generously made herself responsible for
his Parisian debts. On the morning of the day on
which he left Paris, his creditors, says his wife, showed
“so great a love and kindness for him” that they
came to “take their farewell of him”. No wonder!
It is easy to understand that they would be anxious,
to have a few words with him&mdash;perhaps a good many
words&mdash;and to come to a very clear understanding,
before losing sight of him. Love and kindness
indeed!</p>

<p>For about six months Newcastle lived at Rotterdam,
as his wife tells us, “at a great charge keeping
an open and noble table for all comers”; although he
was heavily in debt and seemed to have little prospect
of ever repaying his creditors.</p>

<p>In addition to the large sums he owed in Holland
and in Paris, he borrowed £2000, while in Rotterdam,
from Lord Hertford and Lord Devonshire, all
of which he spent there, as well as another £1000
which he borrowed; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>“his expense being the more,
by reason he lived freely and nobly,” which, of course,
he had no business to do.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_131_131" id="Footnote_131_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131_131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> About this time Lady Newcastle lost her brother, Sir Charles
Lucas, a very brave Cavalier, who, as she says, “was most inhumanly
murthered and shot to death” at Colchester by the Parliamentary
army.</p></div>

<p>While at Rotterdam, he made visits to the Prince
of Wales at the Hague. Finding that he could be of
no help to the Prince, and probably also finding that
he could borrow no more money in Rotterdam, he
went to Antwerp, where he took a house<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> “that belonged
to the widow of a famous Picture-drawer, Van
Ruben”. Here, however, was a difficulty, for the
Widow Rubens’s house was “to be let unfurnished,”
and Newcastle had no cash with which to buy furniture.
Happily he was a past-master in the art of
borrowing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>His wife says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“About this time my Lord was much necessitated
for Money, which forced him to try several ways for
to obtain so much as would relieve his present wants.
At last Mr. <em>Alesbury</em>, the onely Son to Sir <em>Th.
Alesbury</em>, Knight and Baronet, and Brother to the
now Countess of <em>Clarendon</em>, a very worthy Gentleman,
and great Friend to my Lord, having some
Moneys that belonged to the now Duke of <em>Buckingham</em>,
and seeing my Lord in so great distress did
him the favour to lend him 200£. (which money my
Lord since his return hath honestly and justly repaid).”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
No doubt! But that was some dozen years
later, and the delay may have been inconvenient to
the Duke of Buckingham. “This relief came so
seasonably, that it got my Lord Credit in the City
of <em>Antwerp</em>, whereas otherwise he would have lost
himself to his great disadvantage; for my Lord
having hired the house aforementioned, and wanting
Furniture for it, was credited by the Citizens for as
many Goods as he was pleased to have, as also for
Meat and Drink, and all kind of necessaries and
provisions, which certainly was a special Blessing of
God, he being not onely a stranger in that Nation,
but to all appearance, a Ruined man.”</p>

<p>While at Antwerp, Newcastle was exempted from
all taxes and excise dues. In 1650 he was made a
member of the Privy Council of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, and he
urged the King to make an agreement with Scotland
on any terms and to go there in person. Hyde opposed
the Scotch policy advocated by Newcastle,
whom he describes in one of his letters “as a most
lamentable man, as fit to be a general as to be a
bishop”.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Yet Hyde and Newcastle remained on
good terms, and, when Hyde was accused in 1653
of betraying the King’s Councils, Newcastle wrote
him “a very comfortable letter of advice”.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>At Antwerp Newcastle’s chief amusement was riding
the two horses which he had bought for £160
and £100, until they both, unfortunately, suffered premature
death. This is remarkable; for tittupping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
round a riding-school was a gentle form of exercise
more likely to lengthen than to shorten a horse’s
existence. Being desperately hard up, it might
naturally be expected that he would give up riding
and economise. Not a bit of it! On the contrary,
finding himself horseless, “though he wanted present
means to repair these his losses, yet he endeavoured
and obtained so much Credit at last that he was
able to buy two others, and by degrees so many as
amounted in all to the number of 8. In which he
took so much delight and pleasure, that though he
was then in distress for Money, yet he would sooner
have tried all other ways, then parted with any of
them; for I have hear’d him say, that good Horses
are so rare, as not to be valued for Money.” He had
excellent offers for two of these horses; but, poor as he
was, nothing would induce him to sell either of them.</p>

<p>So difficult did Newcastle find it to keep eight
horses and himself, to say nothing of his wife, with
scarcely any money in hand, and a rapidly diminishing
credit, that it became necessary, not to reduce his
stud, but to send his wife to England to try to raise
the wind. He could spare her, but not his horses.
With Lady Newcastle went Newcastle’s brother,
Sir Charles Cavendish, whose property, which had
been sequestered since he left England, was to be
sold outright if he did not quickly compound for it.</p>

<p>Lady Newcastle and Sir Charles had so little money
for their journey that they were obliged to stay at
Southwark, until Sir Charles had pawned his watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>to pay for their night’s lodging and for the very short
remainder of their journey into London, where they
found lodgings in Covent Garden. The Duchess’s
book relates what followed.</p>

<p>“Having rested our selves some time, I desired my
Brother the Lord <em>Lucas</em>, to claim, in my behalf, some
subsistence for my self out of my Lords Estate (for it
was declared by the Parliament, That the Lands of
those that were banished, should be sold to any that
would buy them, onely their Wives and Children were
allowed to put in their Claims:) But he received this
Answer, That I could not expect the least allowance,
by reason my Lord and Husband had been the
greatest Traitor of <em>England</em> (that is to say, the honestest
man, because he had been most against them).”</p>

<p>Newcastle had felt some compunction about compounding
with traitors to his King. Henrietta Maria
very kindly wrote to him, saying that she had heard of
his scruples from Lord Jermyn, adding: “I am sufficiently
assured of your affection and fidelity to tell you,
that I think the king cannot be displeased that you
should do what the late king his father”&mdash;it was after
the death of Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>&mdash;“permited those to do who
had served him, when he was not in a condition to
assist them.... And I cannot forbear pitying you,
knowing well your repugnance to treat with these
abominable villains.”</p>

<p>The Duchess continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then Sir <em>Charles</em> intrusted some persons to compound
for his Estate; but it being a good while before they
agreed in their Composition, and then before
the Rents could be received, we having in the mean
time nothing to live on, must of necessity have been
starved, had not Sir <em>Charles</em> got some Credit of several
Persons, and that not without great difficulty; for all
those that had Estates, were afraid to come near him,
much less to assist him, until he was sure of his own
Estate. So much is Misery and Poverty shun’d!”
No novel discovery.</p>

<p>“But though our Condition was hard, yet my dear
Lord and Husband, whom we left in <em>Antwerp</em>, was
then in a far greater distress than our selves.”</p>

<p>In fact his creditors had become very “impatient”&mdash;who
can wonder?&mdash;and he wrote to his wife that,
unless some money were sent to him immediately, he
would starve. With very great difficulty Sir Charles
Cavendish raised £200, which he sent out at once to
his brother. We need not enter into the details of
Sir Charles’s compounding for his estates, or of his
saving Welbeck and Bolsover for Newcastle.</p>

<p>During her stay in England, Lady Newcastle consoled
herself in her anxieties with pens and paper, of
which we shall hear a good deal later.</p>

<p>It was probably not very long before Lady Newcastle’s
visit to London that King Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> was
beheaded, an incident unmentioned in her memoirs.
But perhaps she regarded it as a tragedy too well
known to require notice.</p>

<p>After being in England a year and a half, having
heard that her husband was “not very well,” and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>having but “small hopes” of raising money out of
his estates, Lady Newcastle returned to him. Sir
Charles Cavendish was prevented from accompanying
her by ague, and she had reached her husband
only a short time, when news came of Sir Charles’s
death.</p>

<p>Clarendon<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> describes Sir Charles Cavendish as
Newcastle’s “brave brother, who was a man of the
noblest and largest mind, though the least, and most
inconvenient body that lived”. Almost the only words
at all approaching disparagement of her husband, occurring
in the Duchess’s story of his life, are in her
already quoted statement that he had “not so much
of scholarship and learning as his brother Sir Charles
Cavendish”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_135_135" id="Footnote_135_135"></a><a href="#FNanchor_135_135"><span class="label">[135]</span></a> <cite>Hist.</cite>, vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, part <abbr title="2"><small>II</small></abbr>. bk. viii.</p></div>

<p>As we have seen, Newcastle had written to his
wife, in England, that unless she or his brother sent
him money immediately, he would starve; therefore it
might be reasonably supposed that he had sold the last
of his horses. Such was very far from being the fact.
When Lady Newcastle returned, she found her starving
husband with “the Mannage of his horses,” as she
calls it, so splendid that “all strangers that were
Persons of Quality” came to see it.</p>

<p>It was at Antwerp that Newcastle wrote his famous
book on horsemanship, which we will notice when we
consider his literary works in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson had written, concerning Newcastle’s
horsemanship:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of his book on horsemanship, Newcastle wrote to
Secretary Nicholas from Antwerp, on 15 February,
1656: “I am so tormented about my book of horsemanship
as you cannot believe, with a hundred several
trades I think, and the printing will cost above £1,300,
which I could never have done but for my good friends,
Sir H. Cartwright and Mr. Loving; and I hope they
shall lose nothing by it, and I am sure they hope the
like”. Only the impecunious can afford to embark
upon literary extravagances of this sort.</p>

<p>Lady Newcastle’s return had one very inconvenient
effect. It had been generally known at Antwerp that
her expedition to England had been for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>of raising money to pay her husband’s debts, and it
was naturally, though most erroneously, assumed that
she had returned with that money. In consequence,
there was a general rush of Newcastle’s creditors to
his house, crowding and clamouring for a settlement
of their little accounts. Wonderful to relate, when
Newcastle “had informed them of the truth of the
business, and desired their patience somewhat longer,”
they were “willing to forbear”. This, says the pious
Duchess, “was a work of Divine Providence”. Undoubtedly
it was; but did not Newcastle tempt Providence
very hard, when he lived in what she admits
to have been “so much Splendor and Grandure” on
borrowed money, with only a very problematical prospect
of ever being able to repay it?</p>

<p>It would seem, from the following letter, written
by Buckingham, that Newcastle had asked him to
beg on his account from Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>; that Charles had
promised some money, and had been persuaded to
break his promise by Newcastle’s enemies. Buckingham
also advises Newcastle to make the best terms
he can with the Government of the Commonwealth
about his property.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of his exile, Newcastle put his
son, who had succeeded in obtaining an income, probably
by his marriage, into his old home at Welbeck,
as will be seen by the following letters.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>“Now, for what is in our power, I pray you live at

<p>The change of title from Duke to Prince, if he
ever made it, did not soften the hearts of Newcastle’s
creditors. Their generosity steadily decreased, until
the poor men appeared to be losing their nerve altogether.
Newcastle, says his wife, “was put to great
plunges and difficulties”. Her chief fear was that
her husband <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>“for his debts would suffer imprisonment,
where sadness of mind, and want of exercise and air,
would have wrought his destruction”. However,
when the yet unrestored Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> “was pleased to
accept of a private dinner at” Newcastle’s house in
Antwerp, “he did merrily and in jest” tell Lady
Newcastle “that he perceived her Lord’s Credit could
procure better Meat than His own”.</p>

<p>The Newcastles also gave Charles something more
than “a private dinner”. Sir Charles Cotterell wrote
to Nicholas:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>“At the ball at Lord Newcastle’s was the Duchess
of Lorraine and her son and daughter, with the King
and his brothers and sister, several French people, and
some of the town. The King was brought in with
music, and all being placed, Major Mohun, the player,
in a black satin robe and a garland of bays, made a
speech in verse of his lordship’s”&mdash;Newcastle’s&mdash;“own
poetry, complimenting the King in his highest hyperbole.
Then there was dancing for two hours, and
then my Lady’s Moor, dressed in feathers, came in
and sang a song of the same authors, set and taught
him by Nich. Lanier. Then was the banquet brought
in, in eight great chargers, each borne by two gentlemen
of the court, and others bringing wines, drinks,
etc. Then they all danced again two hours more,
and Major Mohun ended all with another speech,
prophesying his Majesty’s Re-establishment.”</p>

splendid and admirably annotated ed. of <cite>The Life of Newcastle</cite>.</p></div>

<p>The report of all this magnificence must have made
Newcastle’s creditors feel a little anxious.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, with the help of the remainder
of his brother Charles’s estate, Newcastle “sprinkled
something amongst his Creditors, and borrowed so
much of Mr. <em>Top</em> and Mr. <em>Smith</em> (though without
assurance) that he could pay such scores as were most
pressing, contracted from the poorer sort of Tradesmen,
and send ready mony to Market, to avoid cozenage
(for small scores run up most unreasonably,
especially if no strict accounts be kept, and the rate
be left to the Creditors pleasure) by which means there
was in a short time so much saved, as it could not have
been imagined”.</p>

<p>Thus, by borrowing from new creditors to pay old
ones, the Newcastles contrived to live in luxury for a
good many years; in short until the Restoration.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s correspondence with Nicholas, among
the Egerton Manuscripts in the British Museum, reveals
his alternate hopes and fears as to the probability
of that event. It is amusing to find a General, who
rightly or wrongly fled from his country, cavilling at
others for doing the same thing. In January, 1659, he
wrote from Antwerp to Nicholas: “There are many
noblemen, or at least lords, that are comed over to
Paris, it is true, but those lords that can take such
sudden apprehensions of fears so far off, I doubt will
hardly have the courage to help our gracious Master
to his throne&mdash;woful people&mdash;and the next generation
of lords they tell me are fools. It will be a brave
Upper House!”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last the long-looked-for Restoration actually took
place, and Newcastle determined to sail for England,
which he could then do in perfect safety, as he would
now be a loyal subject in that country instead of a
traitor specially excepted from any possibility of pardon.</p>

<p>The only difficulty in returning to his country was
the objection made by his creditors to his leaving Holland
until his debts were paid. But Newcastle was a
resourceful debtor; and he surmounted the difficulty
by the very simple expedient of pawning&mdash;not his
wife’s clothes this time, but his wife herself! Being
in another part of Holland, says that lady, “my Lord
declared his intention of going for England, withal
commanding me to stay in that city (Antwerp), as a
Pawn for his debts, until he could compass money to
discharge them”.</p>

<p>“Being in another part of Holland!” Yes! It is
certainly pleasanter to express desires of such a nature
to one’s wife by letter rather than in person.</p>

<p>Having left his wife in pawn at Antwerp, Newcastle
started in excellent spirits for England.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“My Lord (who was so transported with the joy
of returning into his Native Countrey, that he regarded
not the Vessel) having set Sail from <em>Rotterdam</em>, was
so becalmed, that he was six dayes and six nights
upon the Water, during which time he pleased himself
with mirth, and pass’d his time away as well as he
could; Provisions he wanted not, having them in great
store and plenty. At last being come so far that he
was able to discern the smoak of <em>London</em>, which he
had not seen in a long time, he merrily was pleased to
desire one that was near him, to jogg and awake him
out of his dream, for surely, said he, I have been sixteen
years asleep, and am not thoroughly awake yet.
My Lord lay that night at <em>Greenwich</em>, where his
Supper seem’d more savoury to him, than any meat
he had hitherto tasted; and the noise of some scraping
Fidlers, he thought the pleasantest harmony that ever
he had heard.”</p>

<p>It is gratifying to learn that thoughts of his absent
wife in dreary exile did not lessen the spirits, the
merriness, or the transports of joy, of the Marquess.</p>

<p>Collins<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> gives us the following information about
Newcastle after the Restoration. Newcastle, on his
return to England, “finding his estate much entangled,
was obliged to borrow £5,000 whereof his
cousin, the Earl of Devonshire, lent him £1,000....
His Lordship lived at Dorset House, during his stay
in London.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“The King had made him a Knight of the Garter
on Jan. 12, 1651; but he does not appear to have received
the insignia until ten years later. By a warrant
of April 10, 1661, the King ordered Lord Sandwich,
Master of the Great Wardrobe, to give Newcastle
‘18 yards of blue velvet for an upper robe, 10 yards
of crimson velvet for an under robe or surcoat, together
with 16 yards of white taffata to line them both’. The
King also ordered Sir Gilbert Talbot, Master of the
Jewels, to give him a collar of gold, ‘containing the
usual number of garters,’ ‘likewise one rich George
on horseback’. After the Restoration, his Majesty
made him one of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber.”</p>

<p>Lady Newcastle says that her husband “at last” borrowed
enough money to redeem her out of pawn; or
rather nearly enough; for even then the amount he sent
over was £400 short, and she had to borrow that sum
from a Sir John Shaw, in Antwerp, to make it up. After
sundry adventures, she sailed for England in a Dutch
man-of-war. When she had joined her husband, she
was rather disappointed at finding him in circumstances
which she did not consider befitting his rank.
“After I was safely arrived at <em>London</em>, I found my
Lord in Lodgings; I cannot call them unhandsome;
but yet they were not fit for a Person of his Rank and
Quality, nor of the capacity to contain all his Family:
Neither did I find my Lord’s Condition such as I
expected.”</p>

<p>Some historians hint that her ladyship found herself
mocked and derided by the gay ladies and the
flippant gallants at the licentious Court of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>,
where she felt out of her element, and that this was
her chief reason for wishing to retire to Welbeck.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>She continues: “Wherefore out of some passion I
desir’d him to leave the Town, and retire into the
countrey; but my Lord gently reproved me for my
rashness and impatience”.</p>

<p>She got her way, however, before long; and Newcastle
obtained the King’s leave to retire to Welbeck.
The only account we have of his financial affairs,
after the Restoration, is that of his wife; therefore,
part of it shall be given here; although even that
part is wearisome, lengthy, and far from lucid; indeed
it may be skipped without serious loss.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Newcastle “kissed His Majesty’s hand, and went
the next day into <em>Nottinghamshire</em>, to his Manor-house
call’d <em>Welbeck</em>; but when he came there, and
began to examine his Estate, and how it had been
ordered in the time of his Banishment, he knew not
whether he had left any thing of it for himself, or not,
till by his prudence and wisdom he inform’d himself
the best he could, examining those that had most
knowledge therein. Some Lands, he found, could
be recover’d no further then for his life, and some not
at all: Some had been in the Rebels hands, which
he could not recover, but by His Highness the Duke
of <em>York’s</em> favour, to whom His Majesty had given all
the Estates of those that were condemned and executed
for murdering his Royal Father of blessed
memory, which by the Law were forfeited to His
Majesty; whereof His Highness graciously restor’d
my Lord so much of the Land that formerly had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>his, as amounted to 730£ a year. And though my
Lord’s Children had their Claims granted, and bought
out the life of my Lord, their Father, which came
near upon the third part, yet my Lord received nothing
for himself out of his own Estate, for the space
of eighteen years, viz., During the time from the first
entring into Warr, which was June 11, 1642, till his
return out of Banishment, <em>May 28</em>, 1660; for though
his Son <em>Henry</em>, now Earl of <em>Ogle</em>, and his eldest
Daughter, the now Lady <em>Cheiny</em>, did all what lay in
their power to relieve my Lord their Father, and sent
him some supplies of moneys at several times when he
was in banishment; yet that was of their own, rather
then out of my Lord’s Estate; for the Lady <em>Cheiny</em>
sold some few Jewels which my Lord, her Father,
had left her, and some Chamber-Plate which she had
from her Grandmother, and sent over the money to
my Lord, besides 1000£ of her Portion: And the
now Earl of <em>Ogle</em> did at several times supply my Lord,
his Father, with such moneys as he had partly obtained
upon Credit, and partly made by his Marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“After my Lord had begun to view those Ruines
that were nearest, and tried the Law to keep or recover
what formerly was his, (which certainly shew’d
no favour to him, besides that the Act of Oblivion
proved a great hinderance and obstruction to those
his designs, as it did no less to all the Royal Party)
and had settled so much of his Estate as possibly he
could, he cast up the Summ of his Debts, and set out
several parts of Land for the payment of them, or of
some of them (for some of his Lands could not be
easily sold, being entailed)....”</p>

<p>From this we learn that, so soon as he was able,
Newcastle sold property to pay the large debts which
he incurred during his sixteen years of exile. With
cumulative interest their amount must have been very
great.</p>

<p>“His two Houses <em>Welbeck</em> and <em>Bolsover</em> he found
much out of repair, and this later half pull’d down, no
furniture or any necessary Goods were left in them,
but some few Hangings and Pictures, which had been
saved by the care and industry of his Eldest Daughter
the Lady <em>Cheiny</em>,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and were bought over again after the
death of his eldest Son <em>Charles</em>, Lord <em>Mansfield</em>; for
they being given to him, and he leaving some debts
to be paid after his death, My Lord sent to his other
Son <em>Henry</em>, now Earl of <em>Ogle</em>, to endeavour for so
much Credit, that the said Hangings and Pictures
(which my Lord esteemed very much, the Pictures
being drawn by <em>Van Dyke</em>) might be saved; which
he also did, and My Lord hath paid the debt since
his return.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> Or, as we should now say, Lady Jane Cheiny, or Cheney, the
wife of Charles Cheney, Esq., of Chesham-Boys, Bucks.</p></div>

<p>After giving a number of figures, including the
former rent-roll of all his estates, she says: “The
Loss of my Lords Estate, in plain Rents, as also upon
ordinary Use, and Use upon Use, is as followeth:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Annual Rent of My Lords Land, viz.
22,393£. 10s. 1d. being lost for the space of 18 years,
which was the time of his acting in the Wars, and of
his Banishment, without any benefit to him, reckoned
without any Interest, amounts to 403,083£. But being
accounted with the ordinary Use at Six in the
Hundred, and Use upon Use for the mentioned space
of 18 Years, it amounts to 733,579£.”</p>

<p>Six in the hundred, or six per cent. and use upon
use, or cumulative interest, sounds fairly high.</p>

<p>Farther on, she says: “The Lands which My Lord
hath lost in present possession are 2,015£. per annum,
which at 20 years’ purchase come to 40,300£. and
those which he hath lost in Reversion, are 3,214£. per
annum, which at 16 years’ purchase amount to the
value of 51,424£.</p>

<p>“The Lands which my Lord since his return has
sold for the payment of some of his debts, occasioned
by the Wars (for I do not reckon those he sold to
buy others) come to the value of 56,000£. to which
out of his yearly revenue he has added 10,000£. more,
which is in all 66,000£.</p>

<p>“Lastly, The Composition of his Brothers Estate
was 5,000£. and the loss of it for eight years comes
to 16,000£.</p>

<p>“All which, if summ’d up together, amounts to
941,303£.</p>

<p>“These are the accountable losses, which My Dear
Lord and Husband has suffered by the late Civil
Wars, and his Loyalty to his King and Country.”</p>

<p>Certainly her ladyship had “an eye to the main
chance,” nor did she wish her husband to lose credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>for one penny that he had sacrificed in the loyalist
cause; but even if we allow for considerable exaggeration
in her statement and object to six per cent. at “use upon
use,” his sacrifices must still have been
enormous.</p>

<p>To descend from very great matters to very small,
it may be remembered that we found Newcastle
having a quiet pipe immediately before the battle of
Marston Moor; and, from the following extract from
a letter, he evidently intended to solace his retirement
at Welbeck by the use of tobacco.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>An important post was given by the King to Newcastle,
namely, that of Chief Justice in Eyre north of
the Trent. Originally Justices in Eyre, or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in itinere</i>,
were delegated with power from the King’s great
Court to visit the counties assigned to them and hear
all pleas. Their functions were to protect the King’s
interests and to try law-suits and indictments. But
the trial of law-suits and criminals by Justices in Eyre
had become practically obsolete before Newcastle’s
time, and what his duties may have been is somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>doubtful; very likely they may have been principally
honorary or even nominal. They would appear, however,
to have included the defence of his large
district; for, in 1662 and 1663, there were rumours
of disaffection north of the Trent, as the following
extracts from letters to Newcastle, among the Welbeck
MSS., will show.</p>

to be 8000£. in debt. Among the items are 500£. for his
own and his wife’s linen, and 700£. for two coaches and eight

the Marquis of Newcastle, amounting altogether to
9240£.”</p></div>

<p>But this must have included interest at a very high
rate, which no doubt Newcastle had had to pay himself;
for a year later we find this letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1663(-4), <span class="smcap">January 20. Welbeck.</span> I have
heard from Mr. Loving that he cannot promise any
allowance for the money due to me from the King,
but only the principal money, which is 3500£., and
that I must have a privy seal for so much as some
others have, and no allowance for interest, which I
have paid ever since the debt was contracted. I have
ordered him to forebear taking out any such privy
seal.”</p></div>

<p>Apparently one of the King’s idiosyncrasies was a
prejudice against “six per cent. at Use upon Use”.
Finding that he could not get repaid even a comparatively
small sum lent to the King, much less any of
the larger losses which he had suffered for the Royalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>cause, Newcastle would seem to have bethought him
that a Dukedom might be better than nothing, and,
from the following letter written by the King, it is
quite clear that Newcastle must have asked for one

<p>Newcastle was that year advanced to the dignities
of Earl of Ogle and Duke of Newcastle.</p>

<p>Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> must have found this a cheap method of
settling accounts with, what he calls in the preamble
to the Patent, his “most beloved and faithful cousin
and councillor,” and of preventing that cousin and
councillor from worrying him with any more requests
for repayments of money. As he had now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>promoted Newcastle to the same position on which
he was soon to place some illegitimate children, what
more could Newcastle want?</p>

<p>There is an extraordinary entry in the list of the
Welbeck manuscripts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>“<span class="smcap">H. Earl of Ogle.</span></h3>

<p>“1665, December 1. An engagement not to

children as soon as he should be free to do so after

<p>It is scarcely conceivable that a son should be
asked solemnly to bind himself, in the case of his
wife’s death, never to marry again so long as a son of
hers should be living! Yet, if this summary of the
document in question is correct, so it must have been.</p>

<p>It is clear that Newcastle arranged, or endeavoured
to arrange, all the marriages and matchmakings of
his children and grandchildren. In reply to one of
his attempted bargains, in the marriage market, he
received the following gentle snub.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

of Newcastle.</span></h3>

<p>(c. 1671). I have received your Lordship’s letter
full of obliging expressions to our family which I am
very sensible of, and for the offer you are pleased to
make of your grandson. I can only say I have no
present exceptions to make against so noble an alliance,
but that it is too early days to think of disposing
of my grandchild [Baroness Percy], whose tender
years are not yet capable of distinguishing what may
most conduce to her future happiness. And when
she is of age to judge I must be so just as to give her
the choice of all those who shall then offer themselves,
and possibly none may be more acceptable to her
than this young Lord.”</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact, when she was “of an age to
judge,” the sole heiress of the eleventh and last Earl
of Northumberland (of the old Percys) did marry
Newcastle’s grandson. And “the age to judge” was
fourteen. Her husband died in the following year;
so she was a widow at fifteen, which she only remained
for two years, as she married a second time at the
age of seventeen,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and she had been engaged also to

made answer if his Lordship would be contented with

I most humbly desire to know your Graces pleasure

<p>Here we see a little of his celebrated match-making
great-grandmother exhibiting itself in Ogle. The
Lexington match, however, never came off. Ogle’s
second daughter married John, second Earl of
Breadalbane.</p>

<p>The next entry in the <cite>Historical Commission’s
Report</cite> of the Welbeck MSS. shows that even
daughters, like other worms, will turn if tried too hard.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Countess of Ogle to her daughter,
Elizabeth.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">1674(-5), March 24.</span>” A letter of reprimand for
ill behaviour and for “one of the unkindest, undutyfullest
letters that ever was writ to a mother”.</p></div>

<p>That graceful epistle seems to have been written
more than a year before Ogle’s letter to his father;
but probably it had been provoked by the family habit
of daughter-dealing.</p>

<p>The best short account of the life of the Duke and
Duchess of Newcastle, after the Restoration, is to
be found in Sir Egerton Brydges’s Preface to the
Duchess’s “True Relation” of her own life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“After the Restoration, peace and affluence once
more shone upon them amid the long-lost domains of
the Duke’s vast hereditary property. Welbeck opened
her gates to her Lord; and the castles of the North
received with joy their heroic chieftain, whose maternal
ancestors, the baronial house of Ogle, had ruled over
them for centuries in Northumberland. But Age had
now made the Duke desirous only of repose; and her
Grace, the faithful companion of his fallen fortunes,
was little disposed to quit the luxurious quiet of rural
grandeur, which was as soothing to her disposition,
as it was concordant with her duty. To such a pair
the noisy and intoxicated joy of a profligate Court
would probably have been a thousand times more painful
than all the wants of their late chilling, but calm,
poverty. They came not, therefore, to palaces and
levees; but amused themselves in the country with
literature and the arts. This solitary state, this innocent
magnificence, seems to have afforded contempt
and jests to the sophisticated mob of dissolute wits,
who crowded round King Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>. These momentary
buzzers in the artificial sunshine of the regal
presence, probably thought that they, who having
the power to mix with superior wealth, in the busy
scenes of high life, could prefer the insipid charms of
lonely Nature, were only fit to be the butt of their
ridicule!”</p></div>

<p>All very true, except on one point. This account,
as well as one or two other accounts, of the post-Restoration
life of the Newcastles might lead a reader
to suppose that during the latter part of their existence
they never went to London. Any such supposition
would be most erroneous. They may have
gone there very seldom; but, when they did go, they
took good care to make their presence felt. As
Pepys will tell us in a later chapter, they made a
great show of splendour, and the Duchess became the
talk of the Town!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER <abbr title="18">XVIII</abbr>.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, after spending sixteen years in exile,
lived to spend about the same length of time in
England.</p>

<p>It might be expected that he would have taken
up the position of a great Cavalier who had made
larger financial sacrifices in the Royalist cause than
almost any other of the King’s subjects, or that he
would have posed as the hero of many battles. Instead
of assuming any such position, however, Newcastle
chose to figure as a man of letters, an author, a poet,
and a playwright.</p>

<p>As an author, he had some claims to the position
he desired; for he had written a standard work.
During his exile he produced a book entitled <cite>A New
Method and Extraordinary Invention to Dress Horses,
and work them, According to Nature by the Subtlety
of Art</cite>. This is mainly an exposition of what is
known as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute école</i> of horsemanship; thus the
most ponderous volume on what we now talk of as
the French style of riding was written by an Englishman.
It is a gorgeous folio, beautifully printed,
splendidly illustrated; and a good copy is worth about
ten guineas at the present moment. If it were a new
book, modern booksellers would doubtless advertise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>it either as an “édition de luxe,” or as “a sumptuous
volume”.</p>

<p>One of the best editions is that by J. Brindley,
London, 1743. That the book was a success, and a
great success, the most malignant caviller at Newcastle
cannot fairly deny.</p>

<p>The work is illustrated by Diepenbeke, whose representations
in it of the Welbeck of those days, and
of Bolsover Castle, have a special interest. Editions
were published in London, Paris and Nuremberg,
both in English and in French. In this magnificent
volume the reader may learn how to train his horse to
make curvets, pirouettes, demi-pirouettes, passades,
voltes and demi-voltes, terms which may also be found
in modern French books upon horsemanship.</p>

<p>Men who fancy that they know all about hunters
may be surprised at their own ignorance when they
read that “Your Hunter ... need not be kept ... to an
exact regimen of diet: any clean food is fit for
him”. If a horse’s wind is broken, it is a simple
matter to mend it again by feeding him on fat bacon,
sweet oil, and brandy figs, or by dosing him with
small shot, pounded in a mortar and mixed with
sulphur. Among other remedies for the horse will
be found “A receipt for ruined nerves,” as well as
“A remedy for the head-ach,” a malady seldom
complained of in modern stables.</p>

<p>No notice of the life of Newcastle would be complete
without a few quotations from the book with
which his name is chiefly associated. Let us begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>with a description “Of the true Seat and the necessary
Actions of a good horseman.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Before a horseman
mounts, he ought first to take care that all his horse’s
furniture be in order, which is soon done, without
prying into every minute circumstance, to show himself
an affected connoisseur in the art. When he is
seated (for I take it for granted that everyone knows
how to mount a horse)”&mdash;a large assumption&mdash;“he
ought to sit upright upon the twist, and not upon
the buttocks, though most people think they were
made by nature to sit upon; however it is not so
on horseback.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_154_154" id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> P. 29.</p></div>

<p>“When he is thus placed upon his twist in the
middle of the saddle, he ought to advance, as much
as he can, towards the pommel, leaving a hand’s
breadth between his backside and the arch of the saddle,
holding his legs perpendicular, as when he stands upon
the ground, and his knees and thighs turned inwards
towards the saddle, keeping them as close as if they
were glued to the saddle; for a horseman has nothing
else but this, together with the balance of his body,
to keep himself on horseback. He ought to fix himself
firm upon his stirrups, with his heels a little lower
than his toes, so that the ends of his toes may pass
about half an inch beyond the stirrup, or something
more. He should keep his hams stiff, having his legs
neither too near, nor too distant from the horse; that
is to say, they should not touch the horse’s sides, because
of the aids which shall afterwards be explained.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>“He ought to hold the reins in his left hand,
separating them with his little finger, holding the rest
in his hand, having the thumb upon the reins, which
should be held strait over the horse’s neck.</p>

<p>“He should have a slender switch in his hand, not
too long, like a fishing rod, nor too short, like a bodkin;
but rather short than long, because there are
many useful aids with a short one, that a long one
will not admit of. The handle of it ought to be a
little beyond the hand, not only for the sake of caressing
the horse with it, but likewise to hold it the
faster. The right hand, that holds the switch, ought
to advance a little before the bridle hand, with the
small end of the switch pointing to the inside.</p>

<p>“The rider’s breast ought to be in some measure
advanced, his countenance pleasant and gay, but without
a laugh, pointing directly between his horse’s
ears as he moves forward. I don’t mean, that he
should fix himself stiff like a post, or that he should
sit upon a horse like a statue; but, on the contrary,
that he should be in a free and easy position, as it
is expressed in dancing with a free air. Therefore I
would have a Gentleman appear on horseback without
stiffness or formality, which rather savours of the
scholar than the master, and I could never observe
such a formality, without conceiting the rider to look
awkward and silly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“A good seat is of such importance, as you will
see hereafter, that the regular movement of a horse
entirely depends upon it, which is preferable to any
other assistance; therefore let it not be despised.
Moreover I dare venture to affirm, that he who does
not sit genteely upon a horse, will never be a good
horseman. As to the management of the bridle-reins
and caveson, I will teach you more concerning them
in the following discourse than has been hitherto
known.”</p>

<p>Here is some safe advice.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>“The Way I took to reduce a Horse, that was
extreamly Resty.</p>

<p>“A Horse’s restiness, when it is in a high degree,
does not consist only in his refusing to advance, but
also in his opposition to the rider, in every thing he
possibly can, and with the utmost malice.... One
must endeavour therefore to gain the horse; for the
perfection of a well-managed horse consists in his
following the will of his rider, so that the will of both
shall be the same.... Violent methods will not do.
For when the horseman thinks himself victorious, he
is deceived, etc., etc. If the rider begins again to
beat and spur the horse will resist again; it is not the
beast then that is vanquished, but the man, who is
the greater brute of the two.... The whole therefore
is to make the horseman and his horse friends.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you can’t gain your point one way, you must
have recourse to another. You would make your
horse advance, and he to defend himself against you
runs back; at that instant pull him back with all your
strength, and if to oppose you he advances, immediately
force him briskly forwards. If you would turn
to the right, and he endeavours to turn to the left,
pull him round to the left as suddenly as possible: if
you would turn him to the left, and he insists on the
right, turn him as smartly to the right as you are
able.... If he would rise,” probably the author
means rear, “make him rise two or three times.” A
very, very dangerous piece of advice! “In a word,
follow his inclinations in everything, and change as
often as he. When he perceives there can be no
opposition, but that you always will the same thing as
he, he will be amazed, he will breathe short, snuff up
his nose, and won’t know what to do next.”</p>

<p>In these days, we are apt to consider good hands
and the skilful use of the bridle of the utmost possible
importance in horsemanship. Newcastle was of a
different opinion.</p>

<p>“The bridle,” he says,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> “I confess, is of some use,
tho’ but little; art avails much more, as all your excellent
riders well know; for I have managed a horse
with a halter only, and he went as well as with the
bridle.... I have also managed an English one with
a scarf, and made him curvet and vault very justly.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_156_156" id="Footnote_156_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_156"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> P. 27.</p></div>

<p>Yet he tells us, later, that, in addition to his favourite
curb, with a high port and rings on it, and appallingly
long cheeks to the bit&mdash;a bridle about which
the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
would have something to say, were it used in these
days&mdash;he liked to have a caveson on his horse’s <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
nose, with the reins fastened to the pommel of
his saddle. By the way, in an illustration, the saddle
which he says cannot possibly be improved upon,
looks more like an elephant’s howdah than the saddle
of a horse.</p>

<p>Here is some queer anatomy with some still queerer
inference from it.</p>

<p>The horse’s<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> “fore-legs are made like those of a
man, having his knee bending forward; and his hind-legs
like a man’s arm, having the sinews of his ham
bending backwards, which is diametrically opposite to
the former. If the hind-legs of a horse bent in the
same manner as those before, he would walk upright
like a man; but his hind-legs bending contrary, they
resemble the arm of a man, and his fore-legs bend as
ours, which makes him go upon all four; and there is
no other reason for beasts going upon all four, with
their bellies to the ground.”</p>

<p>Newcastle apparently did not realise that a man’s
wrist corresponds to a horse’s knee, and a man’s heel
to a horse’s hock.</p>

<p>The following extract will show hunting-men how
little they know about leaping:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For Leaping-horses, there are four several airs,
which are Croupades, Balotades, Caprioles, and a
Step and a Leap....</p>

<p>“Croupades is a leap where the horse pulls up his
hinder legs, as if he drew or pulled them up into his
body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Balotades is a leap where the horse offers to strike
out with his hinder legs, but doth not, and makes only
an offer or half strokes; showing only the shoes of his
hinder legs, but doth not strike, only makes an offer,
and no more.</p>

<p>“Caprioles is a leap, that when the horse is at
the full height of his leap he yerks, or strikes out
his hinder legs, as near and as even together, and
as far out as ever he can stretch them, which the
French call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouër l’aiguilette</i>, which is, to tie the
point.”</p>

<p>It is a pity that the Duke does not inform his
readers which of the “four several airs” of “the
leaping-horse” are respectively most suitable for the
negotiation of oxers, bulfinches and brooks.</p>

<p>In training the horse to make demi-pirouettes,
demi-voltes, etc., not content with the powerful curb,
the caveson with its reins fastened to the pommel of
the saddle, and having the horse’s head tied by a
rope to a pole fixed in the ground, Newcastle would
have his rider wear terrible spurs on his heels and
carry a <em>poinson</em>, which was a “short stick with an
iron point at one end of it,” in his hand. And, as if
even all this were not enough, he would have two
men on foot to “help” the horse, one with a switch
in his hand and the other with a “Scourge”. By
these gentle means, he tells us, horses may acquire
“airs built only of art”.</p>

<p>Let us next learn something about curvets.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_158_158" id="Footnote_158_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> P. 65.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>“To work a horse in Curvets backwards upon the
Voltes.</p>

<p>“The pillar being on the right side, to the right
you must advance your breast and pull in your belly,
your bridle-hand on the contrary side, putting it very
much out and back each time, and helping at the
same time with the opposite leg. This is to make
him go in a circle; but all the aids must be given in
the right time. The rein and contrary leg here works
the horse’s croupe, and his shoulders are at liberty.”</p>

<p>Here we have a highly scientific description of
“Curvets upon the Voltes, sideways”.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_159_159" id="Footnote_159_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_159_159"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> P. 77.</p></div>

<p>“The horse’s hind-legs that are out ought to
follow the fore-legs that are in, neither more in nor
more out; the fore-legs however are within the lines
of the hind ones, since they are narrower. The pillar
or center is without the head of the horse when you
work the croupe out, for which reason his fore-legs
describe the smallest circles, and those behind the
largest. The fore-leg within the volte describes the
least of the two smaller, and the other fore-leg the
largest of them. The hind-leg within the volte describes
the least of the larger circles, and the other
without the volte the greatest.”</p>

<p>It is pleasant to contemplate what the face of a
British groom would be like if the above instructions
were given to him before getting into the saddle.</p>

<p>Let not the conceited modern horseman smile at
any of these quotations from Newcastle’s great book.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">From Newcastle’s book on horsemanship</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>He was a professor of a style of horsemanship
which went out of fashion in this country long ago,
but culminated in France some two hundred years
later than the days of Newcastle, under those two
great masters of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Haute École</i>, Baucher and
Captain Raabe.</p>

<p>It was not only in the pirouetting and demi-volting
of horses that Newcastle interested himself. After
the Restoration, he went on the Turf; although it is
doubtful whether he raced except at Welbeck.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Near
that place he established a race-course, where he held
no less than six meetings in the year, and the races at
them were run under special rules of his own making.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_160_160" id="Footnote_160_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_160_160"><span class="label">[160]</span></a> <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>, <abbr title="9">IX</abbr>, 368.</p></div>

<p>Some years earlier (in 1659) he had denied all
knowledge of racing&mdash;or horse-coursing, as he called
it&mdash;in a letter to Nicholas (<cite>Egerton MSS.</cite>, British
Museum). “It is two professions, a good horseman
and a Horse courser. I pretend to the first, but know
nothing of the second, for I’ll cozen nobody; I only
take care not to be cozened.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> book noticed in the last chapter is the most important
that Newcastle ever wrote; but he also wrote
poems and plays. Granger says:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>“William, Marquis of Newcastle, who amused himself
at this period with poetry and horsemanship was,
as a natural consequence of his rank, much esteemed
as a poet. His poetical works, which consist of plays
and poems, are very little regarded; but his fine book
of horsemanship is still in esteem.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Another critic held a far higher opinion of Newcastle’s
plays and poems, and praised him also as a patron of
men-of-letters. Langbaine, who was almost his contemporary,
says:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>“To speak first of his acquaintance with the Muses,
and his affable deportment to all their votaries, no
person since the time of Augustus better understood
dramatic poetry, nor more generously encouraged
poets; so that we may truly call him our English
Mecaenas. He had a more particular kindness for
that great master of dramatic poesy, the excellent
Jonson, and ‘twas from him that he attained to a perfect
knowledge of what was to be accounted true
humour in comedy. How well he has copied his
master, I leave to the critics: but I am sure our late,
as well as our present Laureate, have powerful reasons
to defend his memory. He has writ four Comedies,
which have always been acted with applause; viz.,
<cite>Country Captain</cite>, ... <cite>Humorous Lovers</cite>, ... <cite>Triumphant
Widow</cite>, and <cite>Variety</cite>. We have many
other pieces writ by this ingenious Nobleman, scattered
up and down in the poems of his Duchess; all
which seem to confirm the character given by Mr.
Shadwell, ‘That he was the greatest master of wit,
the most exact observer of mankind, and the most
accurate judge of humour that ever he knew’.”</p>

1691, p. 396.</p></div>

<p>It is only fair to add that on page 104 of a later
edition of the same book, published in 1699 and entitled,
“The Lives And Characters Of The English
Dramatick Poets, First Begun By Mr. Langbain, Improved
and Continued Down To This Time By A
Careful Hand,” we read, concerning the above notice
of Newcastle:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Langbain has always a good word for quality;
he can see no Blemish in a Person that has a Title,
tho’ he be so sharp-sighted in all those of a lower
station; and he is so transported on the worthy
Nobleman” (Newcastle) “that he baulks the Curiosity
of his Readers, for some Account of his Life, to vent
a clumsey Flattery”.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p>Let us hear another critic. Walpole says:<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> “As
an author he is familiar to those who scarce know any
other author ... from his book of horsemanship....
He was fitter to break Pegasus for a manage than
to mount him on the steeps of Parnassus.... One
does not know whether to admire the philosophy or
smile at the triflingness of this<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> peer, who after sacrificing
such a fortune for his Master and enduring such
calamities for his country, could accommodate his mind
to the utmost idleness of literature.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

ed., 1759, vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, p. 12 <abbr title="sequel"><i>seq.</i></abbr></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_164_164" id="Footnote_164_164"></a><a href="#FNanchor_164_164"><span class="label">[164]</span></a> The plural is used in the original, as Walpole wrote “of this
and the last-mentioned Peer,” namely the Marquess of Winchester.</p></div>

<p>In this instance, the critic has been criticised. Newcastle’s
“elegant and retired studies,” says Lodge,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
“his adoption of which in truth denoted the greatness
of his spirit, a late noble person has endeavoured to
ridicule ... with less taste and justice than are commonly
to be found in his censures, and with more
than his usual spleen”. Lodge is probably right in
saying that, although Newcastle “could not claim the
higher attributes of a dramatic author ... he was a
close observer, and a faithful delineator of the characters
and manners of ordinary society”.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give long extracts from
Newcastle’s plays here; but one or two are offered
from “The Humorous Lovers,” a comedy of which
even Walpole says that it was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>“acted by his Royal
Highnesses servants,” that it “was received with
great applause, and esteemed one of the best plays at

A gentleman in love with Emilia,” and “Emilia, a
gentlewoman in love with Courtly”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>It is curious that Pepys should have attributed this
play to the Duchess. On 30 March, 1667, he wrote
in his Diary: “To see the silly play of my Lady
Newcastle called ‘The Humorous Lovers’; the most
silly thing that ever came upon a stage. I was sick
to see it, but yet would not but have seen it, that I
might the better understand her.”</p>

<p>Of another play attributed to Newcastle, “Sir Martin
Marall,” Pepys wrote on 16 August, 1667: “My wife
and I to the Duke’s playhouse, where we saw the
new play acted yesterday, ‘The Feign Innocence, or
Sir Martin Marall’; a play made by my Lord Duke
of Newcastle, but, as everybody says, corrected by
Dryden. It is the most entire piece of mirth, a
complete farce from one end to the other that
certainly ever was writ. I never laughed so in all
my life, and at very good wit therein, not fooling.”</p>

<p>After all this high praise, it is painful to a writer of a
panegyric on Newcastle, to read in the <cite>Encyclopædia
Britannica</cite> that he “translated Molière’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Etourdi</i>
under the title ‘Sir Martin Mar-All’”. Almost worse
still is it to read, in <cite>The Dictionary of National
Biography</cite>, that Newcastle “translated Molière’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Etourdi</i>, which Dryden”&mdash;not Newcastle&mdash;“converted
into a play”.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the assistance rendered by
Dryden in what Pepys calls the making of this play,
he certainly wrote its prologue and epilogue, which
may be found in his collected works. They are by
no means the most brilliant efforts of Dryden’s genius.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>The severe critic of Langbaine’s worship of nobility,
already quoted, says of Newcastle’s play, “The
Triumphant Widow”: “This was esteemed a good
Play, and Mr. Shadwell had so good an opinion of it,
that he borrowed a great part thereof to compleat his
Comedy called <cite>Bury Fair</cite>”.</p>

<p>In a poem entitled “The Philosopher’s Complaint,”
Newcastle professes to watch a philosopher in his
study, through a cranny in the wall. He hears him
bewailing his fate in being a man and not a beast.
The poem is long. Here are a few verses:&mdash;</p>

thought that they were never jealous! And how pleased dogs are
at seeing another dog beaten. As to “dissembling,” a bird, at any
rate, will pretend to have a broken wing in order to draw away
attention from her brood. And has not the fox a reputation for
“dissembling ways”?</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<p>Probably Newcastle shone more as a patron, than
as a producer, of literature. Besides the men-of-letters
whom he placed on the staff of his army in the North,
he befriended Ben Jonson, a poet who was often in
need of help in a pecuniary form, and also Shadwell,
who, like Newcastle, only on an infinitely humbler
scale, had lost a large part of his fortune in the
service of his King. Both Jonson and Shadwell
were Poets Laureate. Shirley and Flecknoe were
also patronized by Newcastle.</p>

<p>Here is a begging letter from Ben Jonson to Newcastle:
“My Noblest Lord and Best Patron. I send
no borrowing epistle to provoke your lordship, for I
have neither fortune to repay, nor security to engage
that will be taken; but I make a most humble petition
to your lordship’s bounty to succour my present
necessities this good time of Easter, and it shall conclude
all begging requests hereafter on behalf of your
truest beadsman and most thankful servant, B. J.”
(Harleian MSS. 4955).<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In another letter he thanks
Newcastle for his “lordship’s timely gratuity”.</p>

<p>One of Newcastle’s most intimate literary friends
was not a poet, but a dry old philosopher. A good
many letters written to Newcastle by Hobbes, the
author of <cite>Leviathan</cite>, are among the Welbeck manuscripts,
and from these a few extracts shall be given.
At the time they were written, Hobbes was travelling
with the young Earl of Devonshire, then a lad of 17
or 18.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">Thomas Hobbes to (the Earl of Newcastle).</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">1635, August 25. Paris.</span>&mdash;I have receaved your
Lordships guift, proportioned to your owne goodnesse,
not to my service. If the world saw my little desert,
so plainely as they see your great rewards, they might
thinke me a mountibancke and that all that I do or
would do, were in the hope of what I receave. I
hope your Lordship does not thinke so, at least let
me tell your Lordship once for all, that though I
honour you as my Lord, yet my love to you is just of
the same nature that it is to Mr. Payne, bred out of
private talke, without respect to your purse. Your
letters since my comming abroad have bene great
testimonies of your favor, and great spurres of my
endeavor, but it seemes your Lordships thinkes silver
spurres have a greater effect, which is an error, but
such a one as I see more reason to thanke you for,
then to confute, and therefore with my most humble
thankes I end this point.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>

<p>“I told Mr. Benjamin and Monsieur de Pre&mdash;who
is Monsieur Benjamin’s eldest sonne, and teaches
under his father&mdash;of the faults your Lordship found
in the horse. For the opening his mouth, they confesse
it, and say that when he was young and first
began to be dressed he put out his head too much,
which they that dressed him endeavoring to amend,
for want of skill, did by a great bitte convert into this
other fault of gaping. For his feete they obstinately
deny that he has any fault in them at all, and
do suppose that the journey may have hurt him, or
his wearinesse made it seeme so. That he has no
other ayre but corvettes, is a thing your Lordship
was made acquainted with before. The greatest fault
is his price, which price adding the forty pounds you
gave me, is a very good reason why he should hence
forward be called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Superbe</i>.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Paris. 1636, July 29.</span> I am sorry your Lordship

But my Lord, he that will venture to sea must resolve
to endure all weather, but for my part I love to keepe
a’land. And it may be your Lordship now will do so
to, whereby I may have the happinesse which your
Lordship partly promises me in the end of your letter,
to conferre meditations for a good time together, which
will be not onely honor to me, but that happinesse
which I and all that are in love with knowledge, use
to fancy to themselves for the true happinesse in
this life.”</p></div>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Same to the Same, at Welbeck.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Payne willed me to go to Mr. Warner who
lives but eight miles off, to get his answer to certayne
letters of his, but one while the frost, and at
other times the flouds, made the wayes impassable for
any but very ranke riders, of which I was never any.
I have a cold that makes me keepe my chamber,
and a chamber&mdash;in this thronge of company that stay
Christmas here&mdash;that makes me keepe my cold.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>The greater part of the letters of Hobbes consists
of disquisitions upon certain matters connected with
optics, and especially upon some experiments made
by Warner. They go far to show that Newcastle
was interested in science, as well as in literature, pictures,
and music. Hobbes also frequently expresses
pleasant anticipations of discussions on philosophy
with Newcastle when he shall visit him at Welbeck.</p>

<p>Another, and an even better-known philosopher,
Des Cartes, is said to have been a friend of Newcastle.
Surely Walpole was too severe when he
accused a companion of Des Cartes and Hobbes of
“accommodating his mind to the utmost idleness of
literature”.</p>

<p>Newcastle seems to have made scientific experiments
on his own account. In a Preface which he
wrote to his wife’s <cite>Philosophical and Physical Opinions</cite>,
he says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>“Dr. Payne, a divine and my chaplain,
who hath a very witty, searching brain of his own,
being at my house at Bolsover, locked up with me in
a chamber to make Lapis Prunellae, which is saltpetre
and brimstone<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> inflamed, looking at it a while, I said,
Mark it, Mr. Payne, the flame is pale like the sun
and hath a violent motion in it, like the sun; saith
he, It is so, and the more to confirm you, says he,
look what abundance of little suns, round the globe,
appear to us everywhere, just the same motion as the
sun makes in every one’s eyes. So we concluded the
sun could be nothing else but a very solid body of
salt and sulphur, inflamed by his own violent motion
upon his own axis.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_168_168" id="Footnote_168_168"></a><a href="#FNanchor_168_168"><span class="label">[168]</span></a> The ingredients of gunpowder, minus the charcoal.</p></div>

<p>So much for scientific inference. But observe what
presently follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This,” he concludes, “is my opinion, which I think
can as hardly be disproved as proved; since any
opinion may be right or wrong, for anything that
anybody knows, for certainly there is none can make
a mathematical demonstration of natural philosophy”.</p>

<p>Well! The exact sciences have advanced a little
since such a statement as that could be made.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the last two chapters we have been considering the
literary works of Newcastle. We must now face those
of his Duchess&mdash;a very much more serious matter.
The quantity of her written stuff was prodigious. The
following list of her books, drawn up by Langbaine,
is enough to cause the stoutest heart to quail. He
says:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>“She has published six and twenty plays, besides
several loose scenes”&mdash;loose they are indeed&mdash;“nineteen
of which are bound, and printed in one
volume in Fol. 1662, the others in Folio, Lond.,
1668, under the title of <cite>Plays never before printed</cite>.
I know there are some that have but a mean opinion
of her plays; but, if it be considered that both the language
and plots of them are all her own, I think she
ought to be preferred to others of her sex, which have
built their fame on other people’s foundations.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_169_169" id="Footnote_169_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_169_169"><span class="label">[169]</span></a> P. 392.</p></div>

<p>Then he enumerates:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">“<em>Plays.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Apocryphal Ladies.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“2. Bell in Campo.&mdash;Tragedy.</p>

<p>“3. Blasing World. Unfinished.&mdash;Comedy.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<p>“4. Bridals.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“5. Comical Hash.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“6. Convent of Pleasure.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“7. Female Academy.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“8. Lady Contemplation.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“9. Love’s Adventures.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“10. Matrimonial Trouble.&mdash;Tragi-comedy.</p>

<p>“11. Nature’s Three Daughters.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“12. Presence.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“13. Public Wooing.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“14. Religious.&mdash;Tragi-comedy.</p>

<p>“15. Several Wits.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“16. Sociable Companions, or The Female Wits.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“17. Unnatural.&mdash;Tragedy.</p>

<p>“18. Wits Cabal.&mdash;Comedy.</p>

<p>“19. Youth’s Glory, and Death’s Banquet.&mdash;Tragedy.”</p></div>

<p>The other seven he does not name; but he says
that to her play “Presence” are added twenty-nine
single scenes which the Duchess designed to have
inserted into this play, but finding it would too much
lengthen it, she printed them separately. Of her
other works he mentions:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The life of the Duke of Newcastle in English.
Folio. London 1667.</p>

<p>“The same in Latin. Folio. London 1668.</p>

<p>“Nature’s Picture drawn by Fancy’s Pencil to the
life. Folio. London 1656, at the end of which
she has writ her own life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p>“Philosophical Fancies. Folio. London 1653.</p>

<p>“Philosophical &amp; Physical Opinions. Folio. London
1655.</p>

<p>“Philosophical Letters. Folio. London 1664.</p>

<p>“Two Hundred and Eleven Sociable Letters.
Folio. London 1664.</p>

<p>“Orations. Folio. 1662.</p>

<p>“Poems. Folio. 1653.”</p>

<p>The reader need not be afraid that much of all
this is to be inflicted upon him; we have already
seen a good deal of her writings; but a few fresh
examples must needs be given. One reason for the
prodigious number of her works was that she always
kept secretaries at hand to write at dictation whatever
happened to come into her head, a second seems to
have been that she considered whatever came into her
head to have been worthy of publication. Cibber says
of her:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Being now restored to the sunshine of prosperity,
she dedicated her time to writing poems, philosophical
discourses, orations and plays. She was of a generous
turn of mind, and kept a great many young ladies
about her person, who occasionally wrote what she
dictated. Some of them slept in a room contiguous
to that in which her Grace lay, and were ready, at the
call of her bell, to rise any hour of the night, to write
down her conceptions, lest they should escape her
memory. The young ladies, no doubt, often dreaded
her Grace’s conceptions, which were frequent, but all
of the poetical or philosophical kind.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_170_170" id="Footnote_170_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> <cite>Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland</cite>, ed. 1755,
vol. <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, p. 164.</p></div>

<p>She herself gives the following long-winded description
of the speed at which her mighty brain kept
turning out matter for “copy,” and what is given here
is a mere fragment of a sentence of miraculous length.</p>

<p>“... the brain being quicker in creating than the
hand in writing, or the memory in retaining, many
fancies are lost, by reason they ofttimes outrun the
pen; where I, to keep speed in the Race, write so
fast as I stay not so long as to write my letters plain,
insomuch as some have taken my hand-writing for
some strange character, and being accustomed so to
do, I cannot now write very plain, when I strive to
write my best; indeed, my ordinary hand-writing is so
bad as few can read it, so as to write it fair for the
Press, but however, that little wit I have, it delights
me to scribble it out, and disperse it about, for I being
addicted from my childhood to contemplation rather
than conversation, to solitariness rather than society,
to melancholy rather than mirth, to write with the
pen than to work with a needle, passing my time with
harmeless fancies, their company being pleasing, their
conversation innocent, in which I take such pleasure,
as I neglect my health, for it is as great a grief to leave
their society, as a joy to be in their company, my only
trouble is, lest my brain should grow barren, or that
the root of my fancies should become insipid, withering
into a dull stupidity for want of maturing subjects
to write on,” and so on, and so on!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>The account given above by Cibber of the young
ladies who “slept in a room contiguous to that in
which her Grace lay, ready, at the call of her bell, to
rise any hour of the night, to write down her conceptions,
lest they should escape her memory,” arouses
our deepest sympathy. Imagine what it would be to
be awakened by her Grace’s bell from a deep slumber
to write down one or other of the following platitudinous
“conceptions” taken at hazard from one of her
books:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have observed, That many instead of great
Actions, make onely a great Noise, and like shallow
Fords, or empty Bladders, sound most when there is
least in them.”</p>

<p>“I observe, That as it would be a grief to covetous
and miserable persons, to be rewarded with Honour,
rather than with Wealth, because they love Wealth,
before Honour and Fame; so on the other side,
Noble, Heroick and Meritorious Persons, prefer
Honour and Fame before Wealth.”</p>

<p>“It is not every ambitious and aspiring spirit that
can do brave and noble actions.”</p>

<p>The world would not have been very seriously
poorer if the Duchess had omitted to ring her bell,
and if these sage “conceptions” had “escaped her
memory” in the morning.</p>

<p>Her best work, at any rate her most valuable contribution
to the history of her times, is the story of her
husband’s life, into which we have already dipped,
perhaps too often and too deeply. In spite of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>pardonably exaggerated praise of Newcastle and all
his works, the narrative, if not always accurate, is
pretty fairly rendered; and if Nature ever intended
that she should scribble at all, it may have been as a
war-correspondent to a daily newspaper, in which case
she was born a little before her time.</p>

<p>It would be easy to sneer at her poetry; but, at its
best, it is not so very bad, although it always contains
some weak lines. Let us look at one or two of her
most successful efforts.</p>

<p>In her description of the Queen of the Fairies, she
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She on a dewy leaf doth bathe,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">And as she sits, the leaf doth wave;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">There like a new-fallen flake of snow,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Doth her white limbs in beauty show.<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Her garments fair her maids put on,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Made of the pure light from the sun.<br /></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In her poem, “Mirth and Melancholy,” both Mirth
and Melancholy try to attract the poetess. Mirth
promises her amusement and sneers at her rival,
Melancholy, in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Her voice is low and gives a hollow sound;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">She hates the light and is in darkness found<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Or sits with blinking lamps, or tapers small,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Which various shadows make against the wall.<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">She loves nought else but noise which discord makes;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">As croaking frogs whose dwelling is in lakes;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">The raven’s hoarse, the mandrake’s hollow groan<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">And shrieking owls which fly i’ the night alone;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">The tolling bell, which for the dead rings out;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">A mill, where rushing waters run about;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">The roaring winds, which shake the cedars tall,<br /></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">Plough up the seas, and beat the rocks withal.<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">She loves to walk in the still moonshine night,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">And in a thick dark grove she takes delight;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">In hollow caves, thatched houses, and low cells<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">She loves to live, and there alone she dwells.<br /></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Melancholy, on the other hand, states that her life
and surroundings, if subdued and retired, are tranquil
and beautiful. It may be remembered that a few
pages back the Duchess said that she herself was
always addicted to “melancholy rather than mirth”.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">I dwell in groves that gilt are with the sun;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Sit on the banks by which clear waters run;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">In summers hot down in a shade I lie,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">My music is the buzzing of a fly;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">I walk in meadows where grows fresh green grass;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">In fields where corn is high I often pass;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Walk up the hills, where round I prospects see,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Some brushy woods, and some all champaigns be;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Returning back, I in fresh pastures go,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">To hear how sheep do bleat, and cows do low;<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">In winter cold, when nipping frosts come on,<br /></div>
    <div class="verse">Then I do live in a small house alone.<br /></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>One of the greatest admirers of the Duchess of
Newcastle’s literary labours was Charles Lamb, who
calls her, in <cite>The Essays of Elia</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> “that princely
woman, the thrice noble Margaret Newcastle,” whose
writings contain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="indent8">Such a sweetness,<br /></div>
      <div class="verse">A virtue in which all ennobling thoughts dwelt,<br /></div>
      <div class="verse">Pure thoughts, kind thoughts, high thoughts, her sex’s wonder.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_171_171" id="Footnote_171_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_171_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> “The Two Races of Men.” </p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>In another of the Essays<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> he writes about “the
intellectuals of a dear favourite of mine, of the last
century but one&mdash;the thrice noble, chaste, and virtuous,
but again somewhat fantastical and original brained,
generous Margaret Newcastle”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_172_172" id="Footnote_172_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> “Mackery End.” </p></div>

<p>And of her Life of her husband he says: “No
casket is rich enough, no casing sufficiently durable, to
honour and keep such a jewel”. Lamb had a special
admiration also for the Duchess’s “Two Hundred
and Eleven Sociable Letters,” platitudinous epistles,
any extracts from which the reader shall be spared.</p>

<p>A favourable, but more moderate criticism of her
abilities is that of D’Israeli, who, in his <cite>Curiosities of
Literature</cite>, says: “Her labours have been ridiculed
by some wits; but had her studies been regulated,
she would have displayed no ordinary genius. Her
verses have been imitated by Milton.”</p>

<p>The latter is an amazing assertion; but D’Israeli
is a literary authority of high standing, and, as a rule,
he was careful in his statements.</p>

<p>The same idea is implied in <cite>The Connoisseur</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>“As
I fell asleep my fancy presented to me the following
dream. I was transported, I know not how, to the regions
of Parnassus.... Pegasus was brought out of the stable
and the Muses furnished him with a side-saddle....
A lady advanced, who, though she had something
rather extravagant in her air and deportment, yet she
had a noble presence that commanded at once awe
and admiration. She was dressed in an old-fashioned
habit, very fantastic, and trimmed with bugles and
points, such as was worn in the time of King Charles
the First. This lady, I was informed, was the
Duchess of Newcastle. When she came to mount,
she sprang into the saddle with amazing agility;
and giving an entire loose to the reins, Pegasus
directly set out at a gallop, and ran with her out of
sight.”</p>

<p>On her return she repeated, at request, her lines on
Melancholy: “Her voice is low and gives a hollow
sound, etc.” quoted above: whereupon Milton, who,
with Shakespeare, had helped her to dismount,
“seemed very much chagrined, and it was whispered
by some that he was obliged for many of the thoughts
in his ‘L’Allegro’ and ‘Il Penseroso’ to this lady’s
dialogue between Mirth and Melancholy”.</p>

<p>Well! Who knows? But what a contrast to the
blinking lamps, tapers small, and shadows against the
wall, of the Duchess, is Milton’s&mdash;</p>

<p>An apology is due for this very facile criticism, but
D’Israeli and <cite>The Connoisseur</cite> rendered it irresistible.</p>

<p>Grainger says:<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> “We are greatly surprised that a
lady of her quality should have written so much, and
are little less surprised that one who loved writing so
well, has writ no better”. He considers, as well he
may, that certain critics were far too lavish in their
praises of the Duchess’s literary efforts. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is a very scarce folio volume of ‘Letters
and Poems’ printed in 1678. It consists of 182 pages,
filled with the grossest and most fulsome panegyric on
the Duke and Dutchess of Newcastle, especially her
Grace. I know no flattery, ancient or modern, that
is, in any degree, comparable to it, except the deification
of Augustus and the erection of altars to him in
his lifetime. Incense and adoration seem to have
been equally acceptable to the Roman god and English
goddess.”</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the lighter works of the
Duchess, it may be well to give a specimen of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>philosophy. The reader shall be left to judge for himself
whether the following extract contains great truths;
if it contains great truths, whether it presents them in
clear language, and whether it explains them in the
fewest possible words.</p>

<p>The extract is taken from the first chapter of a work
entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Observations upon Experimental Philosophy.</cite></p>

<p>“Written by The Thrice Noble, Illustrious and
Excellent Princesse The Duchess of Newcastle.
Printed by A. Maxwell, London 1666.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reason reforms and instructs sense, in all its
actions; But both the rational and sensitive knowledge
and perception, being divideable as well as composeable,
it causes ignorance, as well as knowledge amongst
Nature’s Creatures; for though Nature is but one
body and has no share or copartner, but is intire and
whole in itself, as not composed of several parts or
substances, and consequently has but one Infinite
natural knowledge and wisdom, yet by reason she is
also divideable and composeable, according to the
nature of a body, we can justly and with all reason
say, that as Nature is divided into infinite several parts,
so each several part has a several and particular knowledge
and perception both sensitive and rational, and
again that each part is ignorant of the others knowledge
and perception; when as otherwise, considered
altogether and in general, as they make up but one
infinite body of Nature, so they make also but one
infinite general knowledge. And thus Nature may
be called both Individual, as not having single parts
subsisting without her, but all united in one body;
and Divideable, by reason she is partable in her own
several corporeal figurative motions, and not otherwise;
for there is no Vacuum in Nature, neither can
her parts start or remove from the Infinite body of
Nature, so as to separate themselves from it, for there
is no place to flee to but body and place are all one
thing, so that the parts of Nature can only joyn and
disjoyn to and from parts, but not to and from the
body of Nature.”</p>

<p>After a careful study of the above lucid passage, it
may not greatly astonish the reader to learn that
Grainger says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“James Bristow, of Corpus Christi college in Oxford,
undertook to translate a volume of her philosophical
works into the same language,” i.e. into Latin;
“but he was forced to desist from the undertaking.
Such was the obscurity and perplexity of the subject,
that he could not find words where he had no ideas.”</p>

<p>In writing about this book, the Duchess gives vent
to the following smoothly flowing lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">When I did write this book I took great pains,<br /></div>
      <div class="verse">For I did walk and think and break my brains.<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And certainly there are unmistakably symptoms of
broken brains in that work.</p>

<p>As we have already observed, D’Israeli has informed
us that Milton imitated the verse of the
Duchess; and, after reading the above extract from
one of her books on philosophy, people devoid of legal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>knowledge may possibly be inclined to think that certain
other scribes have imitated her prose, namely
lawyers in drawing up deeds and wills.</p>

<p>At the end of one of her books, entitled <cite>Philosophical
Opinions</cite>, the Duchess wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Of all my works this work which I have writ,<br /></div>
      <div class="verse">My best beloved and greatest favourite,<br /></div>
      <div class="verse">I look upon it with a pleasing eye,<br /></div>
      <div class="verse">I take pleasure in its sweet company.<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Probably few authors, after re-reading the manuscripts,
correcting the proofs, and again correcting the
revised proofs of their books, ever find “sweet company”
in them again. In most cases the only printed
things they read in connexion with them, in the
future, are reviews. Nor do these invariably prove
“sweet company”.</p>

<p>The Duchess wrote books on all sorts of subjects.
Not the least curious are her <cite>Orations of Divers
Sorts Accommodated to Divers Places</cite>, a work which,
strange to say, went through two editions. It contains
orations suited, or professing to be suited, for
weddings, funerals, and battlefields, loyal speeches and
seditious speeches, speeches in favour of taxation and
speeches against taxation, and after-dinner speeches
both for “a quarter-drunk gentleman” and for “a half-drunken
gentleman”. The Duchess writes the heaviest
stuff of all when she tries to be funny. She is even
heavier as a Wit than as a Philosopher.</p>

heavy, wearisome style in a few sentences from her
play, “The Presence”.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Conversant.</em> Jupiter bless us! how fine and brave you are in a
rich suit of clothes: is this your wedding-day?</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Spend.</em> No, this day is not my wedding-day: but the suit is my
wooing-suit, for I am going to woo an old lady, who is
very rich.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Conv.</em> Is she wise?</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Spend.</em> I hope not, for if she were, she would never grant my
suit, but if she be a fool, as I hope she is, then youth
and bravery will win her.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Conv.</em> And the more sprightly, lively and fantastical you appear,
the better the old lady will like you.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Spend.</em> I believe you, but I doubt that the sight of the old lady

I shall not please her.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Spend.</em> I cannot imagine her a young beauty, when I see her:

comic.</p>

studied a speech.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Mimick.</em> Yes, I have studied, as orators use to do, in making an

since you have taken so much pains.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Mimick.</em> Labour and study is not a certain rule for wise, witty or

are very foolish, but you will hear my speech?</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Sir W. Sage.</em> I will.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Mimick.</em> But then Master, you must stand for, signifie, or represent
a multitude or an assembly.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Sir W. Sage.</em> That is impossible, being but a single person.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Mimick.</em> Why doth not a single figure stand for a number, as
the figure of five, eight or nine, and joining ciphers to

figure nine and so you and the joint-stool make nine

<p>In our third and last quotation, we have a specimen
of what she considered wit. It is from “The Wit’s

<p class="indent"><em>Dick.</em> Then here’s a health to the wisest man.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Cornet.</em> You may as well drink a health to a drop of water in the
ocean.</p></div>

<p>Possibly the reader may think that a little of this
sort of wit goes a long way. Unfortunately, in the
Duchess’s plays, there is a vast amount of it.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable sign of the times in which she
lived, especially of the moral tone and the taste of those
times, that, although the Duchess of Newcastle was a
most virtuous woman, and one of high principles&mdash;Ballard<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
says that she was “truly pious, charitable and
generous: was an excellent economist, very kind to
her servants, and a perfect pattern of conjugal love
and duty”&mdash;yet her plays were of such a character that,
as they stand, the most lenient official censor of our
generation would certainly refuse to allow them to
be acted: nor is it too much to say of them that they
combine indecency and obscenity with the stagnate
dullness so usually the accompaniment of literary
ditch-water. Yet in the Preface to one of her books
she says: “I hope this work of mine will rather
quench amorous passions than inflame them, and
beget chaste thoughts,” etc.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_178_178" id="Footnote_178_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_178_178"><span class="label">[178]</span></a> <cite>Memoirs of British Ladies who have been celebrated for their
Writings</cite>, etc., by George Ballard, ed. 1785, p. 213.</p></div>

<p>The critics of the plays and other works of the
Duchess were very far from being of one and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>same mind. Some half century after her death,
Horace Walpole, in his <cite>Royal and Noble Authors</cite>,
says that “though she had written philosophy it seems
she had read none,” and that she had an “unbounded
passion for scribbling”.</p>

<p>During her life, in fact in the year 1667, the Master
and Fellows of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College, Cambridge, addressed
her in the language of fulsome flattery quoted
at the opening of the first chapter of the present
volume. But all the critics of her own day were not
of their opinion and M. Emile Montégut, in his excellent
essay on the Newcastles, writes:<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> “this very
high and mighty lady” was “very maliciously ridiculed
by her contemporaries and scornfully neglected by the
succeeding generations”.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Vice-Chancellor and the
Senate of the University of Cambridge, fairly excelled
the Master and Fellows of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College in
flattery, and Ananias in mendacity, when they exclaimed:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>“Most excellent Princess, you have unspeakably
obliged us all; but not in one respect alone, for whensoever
we find ourselves nonplus’d in our studies, we
repair to you as to our oracle: if we be to speak, you
dictate to us: if we knock at Apollo’s door, you alone
open to us: if we compose an History, you are the remembrancer:
if we be confounded and puzzled among
the philosophers, you disentangle us and assoil our
difficulties”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>
<p>Grainger says that “these monstrous strains of
panegyrics relate chiefly to that wild philosophy which
would have puzzled the whole Royal Society”.</p>

<p>Pearson, Master of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College, Cambridge
(“Pearson On The Creed”), afterwards Bishop of
Chester, could lie so grossly as to exclaim to the
Duchess:<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> “What shall we think of your Excellency,
who are both a Minerva and an Athens in yourself,
the Muses as well as an Helicon, Aristotle as well as
his Lycaeum?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_181_181" id="Footnote_181_181"></a><a href="#FNanchor_181_181"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> <cite>Biog. Brit.</cite>, ed. Kippis.</p></div>

<p>Another Bishop, Bishop Wilkins, was more honest.
He had been talking to the Duchess about his book
on the possibility of a journey to the moon. “Doctor,”
she said, “where am I to find a place for waiting in
the way up to that Planet?” “Madam,” he replied,
“of all people in the world, I never expected that
question from you, who have built so many castles in the
air, that you may be every night at one of your own.” <a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>M. Montégut says that, during her later years she
was often spoken of as “That fool, Mad Madge
of Newcastle”. Yet Kippis states that the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Knightly Chatwood, afterwards Dean of Gloucester,
“wrote a preposterously over-laudatory elegy” on her
death, “in whose guilt the author of this note would
be involved, were he to produce any quotation from
so impious a performance”.</p>

<p>Of course the Duchess has much to say about her
own literary powers. Here is a specimen of it:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>
<p>“But it pleased God to command his Servant
Nature to indue me with a Poetical and Philosophical
Genius, even from my Birth: for I did write some
Books in that kind, before I was twelve years of
Age”.</p>

<p>One very precious and very touching criticism of
our Duchess has happily been preserved. It was made
by her devoted husband, the Duke himself. A friend
had congratulated him on having such a very wise
woman as his wife; whereupon, he exclaimed with
genuine emotion: “Sir, a very wise woman is a very
foolish thing”.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_183_183" id="Footnote_183_183"></a><a href="#FNanchor_183_183"><span class="label">[183]</span></a> <cite>Richardsonia</cite>, by Jonathan Richardson, pp. 249, 250.</p></div>

<p>It is consoling to learn that the Duchess could
sometimes condescend to lower matters than literature.
We have Her Grace’s own authority for stating
that she was fond of dress. She says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I took great delight in attiring, fine dressing, and
fashions, especially such fashions as I did invent myself,
not taking that pleasure in such fashions as was
invented by others: also I did dislike any should follow
my Fashions, for I always took delight in a singularity,
even in accoutrements of habits, but whatsoever I was
addicted to, either in fashion of Cloths, contemplation
of Thoughts, actions of Life, they were Lawful,
Honest, Honourable, and Modest, of which I can
avouch to the world with a great confidence, because
it is a pure Truth”.</p>

<p>Next, let us hear what Pepys has to say about her
dress and other matters, in an entry in his Diary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>containing another notice of “The Humorous
Lovers”.</p>

<p>“1667, April 11th. To White Hall, thinking there
to have seen the Duchesse of Newcastle’s coming this
night to Court to make a visit to the Queene, the King
having been with her yesterday to make her a visit
since her coming to town. The whole story of this
lady is a romance, and all she does is romantic. Her
footmen in velvet coats, and herself in an antique dress,
as they say, and was the other day at her own play
‘The Humourous Lovers’; the most ridiculous thing
that ever was wrote, but yet she and her Lord mightily
pleased with it; and she, at the end, made her respects
to the players from her box, and did give them thanks.
There is as much expectation of her coming to Court,
that so people may come to see her, as if it were the
Queene of Sweden, but I lost my labour, for she did
not come this night.”</p>

<p>On the 26th of the same month, Pepys was more
fortunate.</p>

<p>“Met my Lady Newcastle going with her coaches
and footmen all in velvet: herself (whom I never saw
before) as I have heard her often described (for all
the town-talk is now-a-days of her extravagancies),
with her velvet cap, her hair about her ears; many
black patches, because of pimples about her mouth;
naked-necked, without any thing about it, and a black
just-au-corps. She seemed to me a very comely
woman: but I hope to see more of her on May-day.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>The Duchess seems to have “got upon his brain,”
to make use of a phrase which came into use long
after his own days; for on 1 May he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That which we and almost all went for, was to
see my Lady Newcastle: which we could not, she
being followed and crowded upon by coaches all the
way she went, that nobody could come near her:
only I could see she was in a large black coach adorned
with silver instead of gold, and so white curtains,
and everything black and white, and herself in her
cap”.</p>

<p>Pepys fairly hunted the poor Duchess through the
streets of London. A week later he made the following
entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Drove hard towards Clerkenwell, thinking to have
overtaken my Lady Newcastle, whom I saw before
us in her coach, with 100 boys and girls running
looking upon her; but I could not: and so she got
home before I could come up to her. But I will get
a time to see her.”</p>

<p>And he did “get a time to see her”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“30th. After dinner I walked to Arundell House,
the way very dusty, (the day of meeting of the
Society)<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> ... where I find very much company, in
expectation of the Duchesse of Newcastle, who had
desired to be invited to the Society; and was; after
much debate pro and con, it seems many being against
it; and we do believe the town will be full of ballads
of it. Anon comes the Duchesse with her women
attending her; among others the Ferabosco, of whom
so much talk is that her lady would bid her show her
face and kill the gallants. She is indeed black, and
hath good black little eyes, but otherwise a very ordinary
woman I do think, but they say sings well. The
Duchesse hath been a good, comely woman; but her
dress is so antick, and her deportment so ordinary,
that I do not like her at all, nor did I hear her say
anything that was worth hearing, but that she was full
of admiration, all admiration. Several fine experiments
were shewn her of colours, loadstones, microscopes, and
of liquors: among others, of one that did while she was
there turn a piece of roasted mutton into pure blood,
which was very rare. After they had shown her
any experiments, and she cried still she was full of
admiration, she departed, being led out and in by
several Lords that were there; among others, Lord
George Barkeley and Earl of Carlisle, and a very
pretty young man, the Duke of Somerset.”</p>

<p>Here is some evidence from another source.</p>

<p>There was a masquerade at Court and that very
smart and amusing courtier, Count Grammont,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> was
talking to the King. “As I was getting out of my
chair,” he said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>“I was stopped by the devil of a
phantom in masquerade.... It is worth while to see
her dress; for she must have at least sixty ells of gauze
and silver tissue about her, not to mention a sort of a
pyramid upon her head, adorned with a hundred
thousand baubles.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Monsieur Emile Montégut</span>, in his essay<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> on the
Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, has dealt with the
question of the Duchess’s religion, at some length;
and the following is a very free translation of a part
of what he has written on the subject. A certain
author has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>“belauded the great piety of the Duchess;
but, after studying all the available evidence on this
point, we are inclined to think that her piety must
have been but moderate and we feel doubtful as to
the nature of her faith and the extent of her religious
fervour. This much is certain, that she was not devout
enough for a Catholic or interior enough for a
Protestant.... When she writes of religion, she is
dignified, but dry, without the least affection in her
language or humility in her mind. She shows no
liking for any particular ceremony, or pious rite or
practice; nor does she seem to attach any importance
to things connected with exterior worship; although
she belonged to that Anglican Church in which controversies
over such matters have always occupied so
important a place. She had some disposition towards
mysticism; but prayer, the most natural of all religious
actions, was almost distasteful to her. She liked
prayers to be short and few, and anything like repetitions
in devotion she considered irreverent if not impious;
but it should be remembered that, in those
times, the Puritans made prayers of prodigious length,
far longer than any made by Catholics.” Her “cool
calculation of the relative values of prayer and good
works at any rate exhibits considerable originality and
piquancy”.</p>

<p>Be all this as it may, she attained that Highest
Heaven of British ambition, a grave and a monument
in Westminster Abbey, and who can doubt that one
who was so very much a Duchess has gone where
Duchesses go?</p>

<p>Certainly the readers, and as certainly the compiler,
of this book must be deeply conscious that it is now
high time to let fall the curtain. And we will let it
fall without fatal illnesses or deathbed scenes. That
people who lived considerably more than two hundred
years ago are dead by this time may be taken for
granted; and it should be enough to say that the
Duchess of Newcastle was buried in Westminster
Abbey on 17 January, 1673; and that the Duke was
laid beside her on 22 January, 1677.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">MONUMENT OF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE
IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY</p>
</div>

<p>The scribe who has collected and copied out the
evidence concerning this illustrious pair, while deeply
conscious of the many faults in his work, is not aware
that excessive flattery of his subjects is one of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>The characters of both the Duke and the Duchess
were certainly open to criticism, perhaps also to ridicule.
Yet much may be said in favour of each.</p>

<p>Newcastle was a dignified, cultivated, and courageous
English gentleman. He was a most loyal subject;
he cheerfully bore greater financial losses, for
the sake of his King, than perhaps any other cavalier;
and he fought bravely in the civil war. He
excelled in horsemanship and he was a fine swordsman.
Although not a scholar, he wrote a standard
work; and he was an appreciative and critical patron
of art, science, and literature. If only a very minor
poet, he could write verses of considerable spirit; if
not a great playwright, he could write plays which
succeeded.</p>

<p>No sensible reader would take Shadwell’s dedication
of “The Libertine” to Newcastle as pure gospel;
but there may be a few grains of truth in it. He says:
“By the great honour I had to be daily admitted into
your Grace’s private and public conversation, I observed
that admirable experience and judgment surmounting
all the old, and that vigorousness of wit and
smartness of expression, exceeding all the young, I
ever saw, and not only in sharp and apt replies, but,
which is much more difficult, by giving easy and unforced
occasions, the most admirable way of beginning
one, and all this adapted to men of all circumstances
and conditions”.</p>

<p>The great misfortune of Newcastle’s life was to be
suddenly forced into the position of a Commander-in-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>Chief,
without any previous training, or personal inclination;
and perhaps the great error of his life may
have been his flight to Holland after the battle of Marston
Moor; but, as was shown on the pages dealing
with the incident, a good deal has been urged, and
may justly be urged, in defence of his conduct on that
occasion.</p>

<p>If he made many mistakes as a General, he never
showed want of courage as a soldier. If he asked
for appointments and honours from the King, he
amply paid for them, both with money and with
services. If his wife said that he was too great an
admirer of the fair sex, there is nothing to show that
he was immoral. If he was somewhat eccentric, he
had a good deal of originality. If he was extravagant
when young, he was economical when old. If
he was ambitious, he never intrigued. If his literary
work is open to criticism, he himself is said to have
been an excellent critic.</p>

<p>Although a loyal, a stately, a polished and a handsome
courtier, he was no hanger-on at Court; and
his dignified retirement to Welbeck, when the licentious
Court of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> had been established,
showed at least good taste. He always appears to
have had enemies near the King, both in the reign of
Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> and in that of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>; but he must
have been very popular in the country, or he would
not have been able to raise such large forces for the
army of the North, during the civil war.</p>

<p>Lastly, he is to be admired for his business-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>perseverance in retrieving his ruined fortunes after
the Restoration, when they were in a condition
which would have broken the heart of a man of
meaner spirit.</p>

<p>As to the Duchess of Newcastle, let us at once get
rid of the idea, held by M. Montégut, and apparently
also by other people, that she was the first of the
Blue Stockings. The origin of that term is well
known. Quite a hundred years after the death of our
Duchess, the leader of a coterie of learned ladies invited
a clever but ill-clad scholar to attend their social
gatherings. He always wore breeches and the usual
bluish-grey stockings of the cheaper kind; and when he
pleaded lack of suitable attire, his hostess said: “Oh!
Come in your blue-stockings”. The little gatherings
of these ladies were afterwards called the meetings of
the Blue Stockings.</p>

<p>But, even taking the term in its wider sense, as including
the learned ladies of any, or of all ages, we
might find women far more learned than Margaret
Newcastle in the depths of antiquity. As to her own
country, a century before her time Erasmus wrote:
“The monks, famed in times past for learning, are
become ignorant; and women love books. It is
pretty enough that this sex should now at last betake
it self to antient examples.” In the sixteenth century,
very literary ladies were to be found in the families of
Sir Thomas More and Sir Anthony Cooke, and to
give Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> his due, it must be acknowledged
that he took good care his daughters should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>thoroughly educated and cultivated women. Nor
was our Duchess by any means the first of her sex to
rush into print in the seventeenth century; moreover,
much as she wrote for the press, little print did she
read except her own, and she seems to have been almost
entirely devoid of scholarship.</p>

<p>Again, in the first half of the century in which lived
the Duchess of Newcastle, unlike that Duchess Lady
Jane Grey knew Latin and Greek and studied Plato.
At the same time, in Italy, the notorious courtesan,
Tullia of Aragon, was a poetess; and, like several of
her contemporary courtesans, knew, as says Aretino,
“all Petrarch and Boccaccio by heart, beside innumerable
fine Latin verses by Virgil, Horace, Ovid, etc.”
Any of these ladies could have taught the Duchess
lessons and put her in the corner as a dunce.</p>

<p>In another sense, Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle,
was unlike what are generally known as literary ladies;
for she was no patroness of literary people; she was
not the leader of any literary set, she started no literary
school; she led a retired life, was nervous in society,
and was so much absorbed in her own writings that
she seems to have taken no interest in those of anybody
else, either ancient or modern.</p>

<p>Had she but spent a larger proportion of her time
in learning instead of in teaching, she might have
become a successful author; for undoubtedly she had
talent, although not genius. The fatal idea that all
her “conceptions,” as she called them, were worthy
of paper, and in most cases worthy of print, was the
chief cause of her literary ruin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<p>The finest feature of her character was her devotion
to her husband. Although she declares herself to
have been devoid of any “passion,” or “amourous
love,” a study of her biography of Newcastle inclines
one to think that on this point she deceived herself;
unless, as is possible, the place of passionate love was
supplied by unqualified hero-worship. She had a
profound admiration for his talents. Exaggerated as
is her praise in the following lines, it at least shows
an affectionate devotion. They occur at the end of
her book of poems:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A Poet I am neither born nor bred,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">But to a witty poet married,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Whose brain is fresh, and pleasant as the Spring,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Where fancies grow, and where the Muses sing;<br /></div>
<div class="verse">There oft I lean my head, and listening hark,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">T’observe his words, and all his fancies mark,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">And from that garden flowers of fancy take,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Whereof a posy up in verse I make:<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Thus I that have no garden of my own<br /></div>
<div class="verse">There gather flowers, that are newly blown.<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And she did indeed “there gather flowers,” if there
is any truth in the pretty general idea that the best
lines in her poems were the work of her husband.</p>

<p>Her expedition to England to try to wrest something
for Newcastle from his worst enemies was a
noble action, and her murmurless endurance of the
pawn-shop, where her husband left her when he
returned to his own country, was a splendid example
of self-sacrifice and patience.</p>

<p>Her lengthy and carefully drawn up statements of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>her husband’s financial affairs testify to her capacity
for business, and suggest the probability that she
was of great help in restoring his fortunes. Indeed it
may be that her talents were more suited for the high-stool
of a clerk than for the arm-chair of a poet.</p>

<p>Walpole’s notice of the later years of the Newcastles’
life is severe. “What a picture of foolish
nobility was this stately poetic couple, retired to their
own little domain, and intoxicating one another with
circumstantial flattery on what was of consequence to
no mortal but themselves.” In all this there is a
measure of truth; but unless they had retired to their
own domain, which, by the way, was not “little,”
and unless they had lived there economically, they
could never have restored the fortunes of their
family. Surely the atmosphere of Welbeck Abbey
was more wholesome than that of the vicious and intriguing
Court of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>; and, if they chose to
amuse themselves with pens and paper, it can truly
be said of them that how much soever they may have
injured their own literary reputations by a rather
injudicious use of those dangerous instruments, they
did not injure those of other people, which is more
than can be said of many other writers, both ancient
and modern.</p>

<h3>DESCENDANTS OF NEWCASTLE.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">William Cavendish</span>, first Duke of Newcastle, was succeeded
by his son, Henry, second Duke, who left no
son, and the title became extinct. But the second Duke’s
daughter, Margaret, married John Holies, fourth Earl of
Clare, who was created Duke of Newcastle in 1694. At
his death this second Dukedom of Newcastle also became
extinct, as he only left a daughter. She also left an only
daughter, who married William Bentinck, second Duke of
Portland, and it was through this marriage that Welbeck
Abbey became the property of the Dukes of Portland.</p>

<p>Although he left large estates to his daughter and only
child, John Holies, the first and only Duke of Newcastle
by the second creation of that title, adopted the eldest son
of his sister who had married Sir Thomas Pelham. This
nephew, after the death of his uncle, was eventually created
Duke of Newcastle in 1715. This was the third Dukedom
of Newcastle, and it was given with special remainder to
his brother. But neither he nor his brother had any children,
and he was anxious that his title should descend to
the son of his sister, who had married the seventh Earl of
Lincoln. To effect this, he had to be given an entirely
different Dukedom of Newcastle; and, in 1756, he was
created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyme&mdash;he was already
Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&mdash;with remainder to his
sister’s male heirs. This was the fourth Dukedom of Newcastle,
and it continues to this day.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
